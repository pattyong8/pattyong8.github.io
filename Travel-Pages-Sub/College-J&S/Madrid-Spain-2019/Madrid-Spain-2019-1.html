											Just as my family came and visited me during my study abroad adventure in China, we went to go visit Vincent during his time in Spain. We got to explore all the amazing places near his residence. We went clubbing, tapas hunting, sightseeing, and even ziplining. There were so many amazing meals and we got to splurge since the dollar went longer in Spain. This was a trip for the books!

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Spring Break just started and I found myself on a plane heading to visit Vincent in Spain! He decided to spend his study abroad semester in Madrid, Spain. What a wonderful choice. It also gave our family the opportunity to vacation in Europe. I had a layover in the UK before transferring to Spain. I remember, it was quite the situation having 4-5 hours to kill in the UK airport.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I landed in Spain and found my way to Vincent’s place! We cooked and drank at his place in preparation for the night to come. He apparently got a crew together to go out the night I arrived. We had a simple meal of chicken breast and vegetables on top of rice <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Once we finished our meal, we played a mini game of snappa before his friends came.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The crew arrived and we hosted a rager pregame before heading off to a club called El Kapital <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. OMG it was a 7 story club! Each floor had a different theme and created a multi-tier setup that anyone could enjoy. We picked a spot on the 5th floor to host everyone we came with and a few others that showed up after. We got a few drinks and started partying the night away.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											At some point we found ourselves on the top floor of the club where food and drinks were being served. It was apparently the smoking floor as well since everyone was smoking a cigarette. I found myself talking to a cute guy that was so my type. Turns out he was gay and we ended up hooking up for a bit haha. The night came to an end and Vinc and I went back to his place so that we could pick up mom the next day.

											We woke up the next morning to get mom from the airport! The Ong family was now united in Madrid Spain! Wow, what a moment for our family. We immediately dropped off mom’s luggage and we explored the city. Vincent took us to see all the amazing sights nearby: Plaza Mayor, the royal palace, and the surrounding area <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>.

											For lunch, we went to a restaurant called Brutal Bar and boooooy, was it a special place. It was
											beautifully plated food with an amazing presentation for an extremely affordable price. I almost thought I was in a Michelin restaurant. We ordered a cocktail that came in a book with some smoke, “Bacon” that was torched right in front of us, duck breakfast, Ahi Tuna, Short Ribs, and a wonderful pork dish <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4 - #11]</span>. We more than spoiled ourselves because after, we went to a famous chocolate and churros dessertery <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #12]</span>.

											I do not remember exactly when we hang out with Erin so I am putting the pictures and memory here. We also went to Brutal Bar with Erin and then got creeps with her after <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #13 & #14]</span>. I am so happy that Vincent was able to study abroad in the same location as Erin. I think it made the experience so much better for the both of them.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Day 3 of Madrid was full of food, sight, and cultural exploration. We started the afternoon at a nearby market called Plaza de Cascorro <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #15 & #16]</span>. It was a full on tourist trap. There were tons of tents tightly packed onto one street, each selling their own version of tourist souvenirs. I found a funny shirt that referenced a ton of F.R.I.E.N.D.S quotes and sent it to Connor and Matt since they are fans of the show <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #17]</span>. Although catered to tourists, it felt somewhat authentic to Spain's culture.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After hanging out at this plaza for a bit, we walked past Plaza del Sol and watched a few of the street performances <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #18]</span>. Our next stop was Plaza de San Miguel where we got a ton of different tapas in a glass building <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #19]</span>. Everything was a bit pricey so we treated this food adventure as a snack. Instead, we stuffed ourselves at a nearby Chinese Sichuan restaurant that Vincent said was one of his regular places to eat at <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #20]</span>.

											One we were done eating we continued to explore the city of Madrid. Vincent took us by the Royal Palace, some famous gardens, and many of the streets that he walks everyday <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #21]</span>. We eventually found ourselves at the Temple of Debod. Vincent has this planned as our end of the day spot since the sunset was beautiful from this look out point. The best part was that we got into the temple right as the sun started to set <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #22 - #25]</span>. Funny memory: as we were sitting against the building, we realized we totally could have hopped the wall while the guard was on the other side of the building in order to skip waiting in line. Tbh, not sure if mom would have been able to get over the wall though lol.

											Mom and I had been eyeing a restaurant called Sumo Sushi <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #26]</span>. It claimed to be an all you can eat sushi restaurant, however, we learned that it was actually a 3 course meal. Observation: From what I have gathered so far Spain’s culture is about eating small servings of many things but not over eating. Thus this “buffet” place was as much of a buffet a place in Spain can get. Vincent had school on this day so our plan was to explore El Retrio Park and eat Sumo Sushi without him and meet him at the Royal Palace in the afternoon. Mom and I didn’t have phone service so we set a time with Vincent and fully crossed our fingers that we would meet up at that time.

											Before we met up with Vincent, we walked around the downtown area of Madrid and walked through the flower gardens of El Retrio Park <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #27 - #29]</span>. It was honestly so beautiful. We met Vincent at the man made pond at the park. We were going to paddle around in kayaks but we figured it wasn’t worth it because there was a long line and it’s not like we haven’t kayaked before haha. Okay so TBH, I mixed up a few of the events on the first day so I will just note here that on a separate day, we did the whole “meet Vincent at the royal palace thing”.

											On that day, mom and I showed up at the palace 30mins early to get in line since there apparently is always a long line to get in and they close at a certain point during the line. It was coming up on the time that we had all agreed to meet but Vincent was still nowhere to be seen. Mom and I were getting worried. Mom and I were getting worried so I had mom wait in line and I went to go see if I could find Vincent. Eventually, Vincent did show up and we were able to get into the palace <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #30 - #35]</span>! Wooohoo! Most of the palace was sectioned off for some reason so we were not able to go inside the main part. Instead, we explored the courtyard and the armory room <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #36]</span>.

											After we had enough of the palace, we continued to walk around the city until dinner time. Vincent then took us to multiple places to snack. The first place we went to had a butter shrimp dish that Vincent was raving about <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #37a & #37b]</span>. OMG it was honestly so delicious. Funny memory: Vincent and I were taking turns balancing on poles on the street and seeing how long we could balance on them with on foot. This was the restaurant where Vincent told us that traditional restaurants in Spain encouraged folks to throw their used trash on the floor each night. Apparently, this was the symbolize that the restaurant was popular/busy.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After this snack, we went to another tapas restaurant for some pizza and other items <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #38]</span>. We even got sangria! The pizza was honestly amazing. It was a simple yet delicious meal :)

											This was our day trip to Toledo! It was around an hour away from Madrid and Vincent had been waiting to visit this city until we came to visit him. We got up around 6am to catch the earliest bus. Mom made sure that we grabbed pastries from a store around the block before we left lol. The bus was located at a bus terminal that we took transportation to get to.

											I tried to sleep during the bus ride but it honestly wasn’t the most comfortable situation so I mostly just snoozed. Eventually, I woke up to the bright sun and started to look around. OMG I could see the city of Toledo in the distance! Wooohoo! I got a great panoramic view of the surrounding city and landscape <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #39]</span>. Before getting to the main part of the city, we walked around the surrounding street at the ground level just to get a feel for the more rural areas of Spain. The architecture was beautiful and the community was vibrant <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #40 & 41]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We eventually made our way of the hill to the main part of the city. When we first arrived, we stopped at the visitor center to get a map to better understand where the heck we were in the city. Our first stop was a free museum full of art pieces from the city <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #42 & 43]</span>. There were paintings, sculptures, and random artifacts. After this, we decided we wanted to explore deeper into the city so we went straight for one of the main attractions, the church.

											The church was absolutely beautiful <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #44]</span>! There were so many tourists around taking pictures, walking around, and just finding a cool place for shade. There were many school groups on either field trips or random spring break programs from around the world.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After visiting the church and walking around a bit more, we sought out lunch for the day. We found a tucked away restaurant without that many people in it. We got a few beers and ordered a dish each <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #45]</span>. I remember the dishes being interesting. I think one of them was a duck dish, another was boar, etc. Either way, our meal was wonderful and we left with a very full belly.

											Mom always has dessert on her mind so we stopped by a sweets shop that had a plethora of different candies. Mom got a few sweets to try since she was looking for something to bring back for her office to share. In this same shop was a Guinness World Record for the tallest marzipan sculpture <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #46 & #47]</span>!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We continued walking around the city. Mom took a nap on a bench while Vincent and I hung around a park waiting for her to wake up <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #48]</span>. The surrounding area was gorgeous. A river wrapped around the city on one side. There were birds everywhere. Eventually mom woke up so we decided to keep walking around the far side of the city until we happened upon a zipline tourist attraction.

											I remember trying to convince Vincent and mom that the zipline was a waste of money and would be so not worth it but Vincent had another perspective. He said that since the cost was only $15 per person, it was so worth having the memory of spontaneously ziplining in Toledo. I am glad we listened to him because it was a whole lot of fun. Each of us gave it a shot, I got a sticker for the experience to put on my water bottle, and it was honestly kinda a wild ride ziplining across a river <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #49 - #51]</span>.

											After ziplining across the river, we decided that it would be a good idea to head back to where we started. We took a few more pictures along the way to capture the beauty of the city <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #52]</span>. When we eventually got to where we started the day, Vincent had the wonderful idea of hanging at the top of the city to watch the sunset <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #53 & #54]</span>. The city and surrounding area looked even better during golden hour. What a wonderful day trip and mini excursion for the books.
