											Today was another day where Vincent had a mandatory class he had to attend. We planned on meeting up with him later in the day. Mom and I entertained ourselves by going to the Prado Museum for the day <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #55 - #58]</span>. We saw some amazing paintings, had ourselves some coffee, and explored El Retiro park afterwards.

										We met up with Vincent at the park and made our way to a taco place that he went to regularly with his friends <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #59]</span>. The reason why was because each taco only costed around $1 and were amazing! They only served speciality tacos which came with unique sauces, ingredients, or garnishes. So tasty! We ordered some regular tacos and then got one with cactus in it!

											After eating dinner, we made our way to a famous rooftop bar called Circulo de Bellas Artes <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #60 & #61]</span>. There was a long line to get to the top and to be very honest… It was so worth it. The view of the city from atop of this building was insane. The sunset was the best I had seen in Madrid thus far. We didn’t get any drinks, because they were insanely overpriced, but we were still able to enjoy the venue.

											OMG we were on our way to Barcelona! Wooohooo! This trip keeps on getting better and better :). Our plane ride went smoothly besides the early wake up haha. When we landed in the Barcelona airport, we were kinda confused as to how to get out of the building haha <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #62 & #63]</span>. Since the airport was under construction. Eventually, we found our way out of the airport. We were starving but had to get to our Airbnb first. Vincent contacted the owner and got access to the place. We put our stuff down and we went out to get some lunch!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We found a random restaurant a couple of blocks away from our Airbnb. Because Barcelona is known for its paella and seafood, we ordered a seafood paella <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #64 & #65]</span>! Honestly, it was just alright but what did we expect going to a random restaurant near the airport haha. After we had lunch, we decided to venture to the nearby seafood market to explore what Barcelona truly had to offer.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The fish market was huge and what seemed to be a packed tourist attraction. There were multiple stalls selling fresh fruit juice so we grabbed a few to sip on <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #66 - #68]</span>. Of course, Vincent opted for watermelon, I got coconut, and mom got passion fruit mango. They were honestly kinda fire. We then made our way to the main seafood section of the market. There were multiple stalls selling fresh seafood <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #69]</span>.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We walked past a stall selling oyster shots. They were literally shucking them in front of us! We immediately knew we needed to grab a few <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #70]</span>. That wasn’t all. We also found a stall that was selling sea urchin aka uni! OMG. I think mom got super giddy over the idea. We immediately grabbed one and got to eat some fresh uni <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #71]</span>! They put a bit of lemon in it and, if I recall correctly, a pinch of salt. Honestly, not as good as a sushi restaurant but still very delightful.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We then ended our day by going to Parc de Montjuic and explored the famous museum at the top of the hill <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #72 - #78]</span>. The entire walk there was beautiful. It was different from the part of Madrid that we had been living in before. This one felt more modern city like. We got a few pictures at the base of the museum. Fun memories: we took a slow motion jumping video at the base of the fountain. We hangout at the base pillars near the large fountain at the bottom for a bit. Since the ledge we were sitting on was a bit high up, we need to help lift mom.

											I got a sick pano of Barcelona and the crowd gathered around us to take in the beautiful sight <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #79]</span>. Once we had our moment looking out across the city. We took a detour walk all the way back to our Airbnb. If my memory is correct, we also stopped for gelado on the way back. :)

											Day 2 in Barcelona was just as great as the first! We spent the morning walking around, taking in the sights, and waiting for our time slot to visit the famous church, Sagrada Familia. Our main location to hangout was Barcelona beach and boy was it beautiful <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #80 - #82]</span>. Honestly, it very much reminded me of a southern california beach. Perfect sand, super blue ocean, and a myriad of different boardwalk offerings. There were many clubs, bars, and restaurants right by the beach. The funniest one we saw was an igloo bar where you were given large coats and entered into a below freezing bar!

											Eventually, it was coming up on our time slot to visit the Sagrada Familia. Apparently, it was just that popular that they gave people the option to book an appointment! This church has been standing since 1882. OMG that is just absolutely amazing. It is crazy to think that the folks back then could build things this tall and stable. The church exterior was breathtaking <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #83 - #86]</span>. There were many mini sculptures that made up the exterior walls. Not only was it an extremely tall church but there was so much detail put into it.

											The inside was even more magnificent. The colorful glass panes split the sun rays in such beautiful patterns all over the inner walls of the church <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #87 & #88]</span>. We went to sit at the main seating area within the church and spent a minute just looking around and taking in this testament of old Spain. We were in the church for one of the organ performances. We got to see it through windows looking into the basement floor!

											Once we had our fun in the church, we walked around until dinner time. For dinner, we went to a highly rated tapas bar. OMG this was unlike anything I had seen in Spain thus far. There were so many small, delicious, and premium looking tapas <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #89 -  #91]</span>. They charged you based on the number of sticks you had at the end of your meal. Each stick had a different pattern to denote price. It was basically like revolving sushi but with tapas. Whoohooo!

											To end the night we walked around without a real plan with the aim of exploring the nightlife of Barcelona for a bit. We happened upon a bar called the Dow Jones bar. We thought the name was interesting so we decided to go in. We got ourselves a couple of drinks and then came to realize that the price of our drink was dependent on the demand for the other drinks <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #92 & #93]</span>. For example, Vincent got a pale ale which made the price of that drink go up by a couple percentage points while all other drinks decreased in price! Omg! What a concept!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I was honestly inspired by this concept and told Vincent that I would like to incorporate it into something one day. Just such a cool idea. We hung around while the bar was still relatively calm. We played pool, threw some darts, and just had a good ole time <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #94]</span>.

											Our last day in Barcelona was partially a spontaneous one. We decided to just walk the streets, try the amazing food, and see where we would end up. We started the morning by heading to old town Barcelona <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #95]</span>. Vincent was saying that this area was full of narrow alleys and old restaurants. We originally had planned on going to a famous restaurant that Vincent found online but when we arrived the line was over an hour! We were so hungry and really wanted to see what else was out in Barcelona so we decided to find another place to eat.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Because of how indecisive we are, we kept walking everywhere to find somewhere that was both reasonably priced and something we thought might taste great. We happened upon an outdoor location with beautiful views of the city <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #96]</span>. We got a few croquettes and breakfast like food. We had to put on sunglasses because the sun was in our eyes lol. The meal was great and we were on our way after finishing. We found a random plaza with amazing stores all around it. It was like a tucked away gem <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #97]</span>!

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After this we ended up heading back to the fish market that we started our trip at and walked around the area. We found this awesome ring of lion statues that people were taking pictures with so we decided to join in <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #98]</span>! We walked around a bit more before we found ourselves on a tourist street with tons of restaurants offering outdoor seating shout out enticing deals. We walked by a couple that we thought looked promising and decided to come back for dinner later.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We then found ourselves in the walking streets of Barcelona. It opened into this grand plaza with lots of entertainment going on. There were dancer performers, people throwing twirling things in the air trying to sell them, and a roped off area that people were setting up something for. We were curious as to what they were getting ready for so we stuck around. All of a sudden, people started bringing out instruments and setting up what looked like a mini orchestra <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #99]</span>. People started gathering around. Once they were ready, they started playing.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											OMG. It was so amazing. The festivities didn’t stop there. People in the crowd then started forming circles, interlocking hands and doing a choreographed dance <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #100]</span>. Then another circle formed, and another, and another until most of the crowd we were with were dancing. We didn’t know if it was a flash mob, if everyone knew this dance, or if this was a regular occurrence but it didn’t matter. What we had witnessed felt magical. I almost wanted to join in!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once they finished the crowd gave a warm round of applause. We took some photos before heading back to the food street in search of dinner <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #101 & #102]</span>. We went back to the restaurant that ended having the most people and the best deal <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #103]</span>. I think the deal was like 3 free sides with an order of paella. We took advantage of that offer and got two paella dishes with 3 sides! Once we finished dinner, we headed to the airport and headed back to Madrid <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #104]</span>.

											This was our last day in Spain. Vincent had school so he went to attend class while mom and I relaxed for the day. I think we walked around a bit and went out for food but mostly chilled since we were exhausted from the day. Before leaving, Vincent met up with us again and we walked around the downtown part of Madrid before heading to the airport <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #105]</span>. We took a final few pictures next to the iconic white hotel at the end of the downtown strip. We said goodbye to Vincent and headed for the airport.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											This was an amazing trip. At this point, our family hadn’t taken many vacations together since that just wasn’t a thing we did with the resources and constraints we had during the previous 20 years. It was so freeing to not have a negative presence with you no matter where you go, with or without it. We were able to do whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted, however we wanted during the entire trip. We deserved this.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I seriously can’t wait for the many more vacations we will go on together as a family. We now got a taste for Europe and I am sure we will be back to explore all the other amazing countries.
