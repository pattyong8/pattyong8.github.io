											Our trip was full of fun memories, new experiences, and sick sends! Noahâ€™s place in
											Mammoth served as our home base. From here, we ventured high into the mountains and
											across the mecca of bouldering. Notable items include getting lost in Bishop, skiing for
											the second time in my life, and attempting to relax in hot springs during a blizzard.
											This trip was the impetus for a new friend group and yearly tradition that will continue
											for years to come.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Cody and I decided to rent a car to get to Mammoth. It was the best way to get there since flying
											would be extremely expensive. The drive was going to be around 6hrs ooooff. The day before we left,
											Noah connected us with his friend, Shiv, since he needed a ride. We left at around 4am. During the first half
											of the drive, everything was pitch black. Cody stayed up with me and we chatted about random things. Eventually,
											the sun came out signalling the start of our wonderful trip. Shiv was up around this point. We decided to chat
											and get to know each other.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After a couple of hours, we started ascending up into the mountains. Soon there was fresh mountains of snow around us.
											We decided to stop at a frozen lake for a bit <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. All of us took turns throwing rocks into the lake. We even crossed the
											highway and half-ass attempted to climb the wall on the other side. After our mini break, we continued on towards Mammoth.
											We arrived in Mammoth! Noah's place is amazing! Tons of beds, super spacious, and very nice.
											The entire crew spontaneous convinced me to go skiing for the day. Thankfully Noah had a ton of extra gear to lend
											else my day would have been way more expensive. We walked to the nearest shuttle and saw how long the rental line was.
											We decided to head for the main mountain.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We waited at a bus stop for a shuttle to take us there. It took two busses, one transfer, and a bit of walking to
											get to our final destination. As soon as we arrived, I practically ran into the rental building to get my gear. Turns out it didn't really matter since we were taken
											to a shop across the street. The folks over there were very nice. We finally on our way! Thankfully, a good number of us were basic skiers
											so there was a group of beginners for me to stick with. Wow I looked funny in all my ski gear <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2 & #3]</span>.
											I spent the day going down greens and trying to improve my technique. In the end, I still kinda sucked. I didn't make much progress. The weather was pretty nice.
											It was actually sunny out.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we had our fun, we lef the mountain. Since Noah and Dylan skiied to the other side of the mountain, they went to
											go get their cars and drive to pick us up. How nice of them. :) Once we got back, we rested for a bit before heading to our first meal.
											We went to a super fancy resturant above a bowling alley. This place was $$$ but a very fun experience overall. Cody and I
											kept making comments to each other about how the place was out of our budget haha. Very funny. I ended up getting the elk
											medallions. OMG super tasty. The portion size was small but that is to be expected at a place with $$$. Unfortunately, Noah started to
											get altitude sickness. I felt super bad for him since he couldn't eat and didn't feel well. We ended up going home and turning in.
											Shiv, Cody, and I got the bunk bed room. What a sick room and home!

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												We got up early the next morning and headed to Bishop to climb! OMG I was so excited to get on some
												rock :). I drove the rental car since Noah's car was not fit for any amount of off-roading. First, we stopped to
												rental a couple of crash pads. Noah also decided to buy a Bishop bouldering guide book.
												We decided to start at the Dreamers first.  Noah directed
												off the main road onto a questionable dirt road. There was no final desination in sight. The road slowly got
												less flat and more rocky. We could tell that something wasn't right. Turns out we took a wrong turn.
												We had to carefully turn around while avoiding all the bushes and mini boulders around the dirt road. The car
												got a bit scratched up but we figured it wasn't too bad.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Eventually, we got to the Dreamers <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Wow it was beautiful and
												the rock felt so nice. I hadn't gone bouldering outdoors that much in my life so it was still a bit
												scary to do high ball V0s. The first climb we "warmed up" on was a V0 with tons of pockets and jugs called Borbon 4.
												After topping a few climbs, my nerves settled and I became more adventurous with the climbs I picked.
												We climbed a V2 and some others before taking a break and eating lunch. Had some super yummy avocado turkey
												sandwiches and beer! <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span> The snow cap mountains around us were absolutely beautiful. So amazing to just to be outside.
												Noah took out some binoculars to look around the area. Cody then used them and saw a rock formation in the distance
												that we wanted check out. Cody being his typical self walk/jogged to the rock formation to check it out.

												After lunch, we got a few "aciton" shots of us climbing with the white cap mountains in the background. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3, #4, & #5]</span>
												We then decided to head over to Happy boulders. Wow, the Happy boulders area was amazing.
												There were sooooo many boulders everywhere! It was basically the Disneyland of the climbing world.
												Noah and Cody were attempting harder problems since their skill level was above mine and Shiv's.
												My favorite climb was this classic V4 <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #6]</span>. Very nice problem.
												I didn't do it but it was very fun to attempt! We also took fun pictures on some V0s <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>.

												Before heading back for the night, we stopped at the natural hotsprings 30mins from the city of
												Mammoth. The hotsprings were in the middle of a rocky grassy field. To get to the hotsprings,
												we had to walk on a short man made path. We finally arrived at the hotsprings. The air was cold
												and we were eager to get in. There were three main pool with varying temperatures. As we were soaking
												in medium temperature pool, a snow storm hit. Omg it was freezing and all of our clothes were getting covered
												in a thin layer white snow. We decided to stay a longer since this nautral event was more fun than not. We got
												some great photos using Shiv's phone <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #8 & #9]</span>.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												After taking everything in, we decided to make a break for the car. The situation was tricky since the snow
												storm was still going on and it was freezing outside of the hotsprings. I volunteered to get out first, run
												to the car, and blast the heaters. Everyone else followed after I got dressed and started up the man made path.
												I practically scrambled to the car. I couldn't feel anything and was numb all over. Everyone else slowly arrived
												to the car and threw themselves in. Wow what a fun way to end the day. We drove back to Noah's place and took a
												nice long rest. Once we felt rested, we watched a climbing movie and went to sleep.

												Got up early to go climbing again! This time, we decided to go to Sad Boulders.
												Since it was my second day climbing outdoors in a row, I felt much more comfortable
												with high climbs and got over my fear of loose rocks. I actually attempted a V0
												highball and got pretty far up before deciding to come down. We probably climbing for
												a couple of hours. During this time, we attempted a range of climbs from V0-V5. We also
												got some amazing pictures of the view! <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1 & #2]</span>
												I also got way better at spotting people while they were climbing. Specifically, I had two
												superb spots with Cody. One of these was a quite dangerous climb. Cody put in a very high heel
												hook 6 feet off the ground and had to trust the foot and reach for a hold. On one of his attempts,
												he missed the hand hold and came falling down. The bad part was that his heel hook made him fall back first.
												I was spotting him and perfectly caught his body to prevent a potentially harmful impact. Cody said it was
												as if an angel came down, grabbed him while he was falling, and floated him down to the mat :). Worlds best spotter
												here!

												We were pretty exhausted from 3 days worth of activites and headed back at a reasonable time to recover and return
												crash pads. We also decided to grab a bit to eat at a Mexican resturant that Noah spoke highly of.
												<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span> Once we got back, we decided to hit the jaccuzi and drink a bit.
												After this, we chilled in the house for a bit, watched some climbing videos and talked about the success of our trip.
