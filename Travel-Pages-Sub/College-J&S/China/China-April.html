											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											April was a month full of wonderful trips, food, and adventures. The month started with a trip to Anhui, a beautiful landlocked region full of towering mountains. This trip was for the OG travel squad: myself, Antonia, Jake, Ryan, and Connor. To get to Anhui, we took a 3 hour train ride from Shanghai. Towards the beginning of the train ride, I decided it would be a fun to blog our entire trip <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #47]</span>. The vision was to eventually create a video full of the vlogs but we didn’t do enough of them for it to be interesting or worth the time. To pass the time, we played cards, talked logistics for our Huangshan experience, and slept.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Eventually, we arrived at our destination. We ended up taking taxis to our hostel in a nifty small town in Jiangxi. We were welcome into the town, unofficially, with cultural street performance <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #48]</span>. OMG we checked into our hostel and found out our room not only had a bed for everyone but contained a fully functioning electronic mahjong machine. Jake was joking that we should stay up all night, drink beer, and learn to play mahjong. The bummer was that we only had this room for the night we arrived and had to move rooms the next day.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we figured out all the accommodations business, we ventured into the town in search of a meal. We found this wonderful small restaurant near our hostel. With rumbling stomachs, we eagerly gave it a shot. Turns out the owners of the restaurant were kind hearted and welcomed us with open arms. We basically asked them for their suggestion with everything and were 100% satisfied. We started the meal with a wonton soup before quickly transitioning to the regions speciality fish called Stinky Mandarin Fish臭鳜鱼 <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #49 & #50]</span>. I was the only one in the group that actually thought it was edible lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We continued to explore the town for a bit. There were many stalls selling random souvenirs and nick nacks. There was a performance going on in the middle of the main plaza. I believe they were rehearsing for a performance that weekend. We also traveled to a nearby breadshop to get snacks/sustenance for the following day. As night approached, we went to a bar, ordered a few beers and catched before heading back to our hostel to sleep. I honestly was not that keen on sleeping and decided to venture out by myself for the night.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I started by exploring the area we had spent the day in but everything in this part of town was closed. Instead, I headed just a bit further out of town to grab a bite to eat. I found a place in a back alley selling typical chinese dishes. I got a mixed noodle dish. It was honestly just alright but I was hungry. Next I headed to the old Tunxi Old Street. Everything was in the process of closing down but I got to spend a good 20 minutes exploring the various spice, sculpture, and food shops. Each of the stores were putting up wooden planks to close down since none of them had doors. Apparently, this street dated back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279). What an experience. Eventually, I headed back and retired for the night in anticipation for tomorrow’s Huangshan adventure.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got up early the next morning, caught a taxi to the base of Huangshan, and got situated for the day. Once we got to the bottom of the mountain, we had to pay a fee for a train to take us even further up the mountain. Ughhh typical tourist things. There were a number of stores along the way selling water, snacks, and desserts. Eventually, we arrived at the base of Anhui. We had to decide between taking a gondola or hiking the trail up to the top. Our friend Ryan asked one of the workers how long the hike was. He reported back to our group saying the hike would take 30mins compared to the 3 hour long wait for the gondola. To us, the hike was a no brainer choice.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											As we started our way up the mountain, we quickly realized that the hike was no trail, it was literally a steep staircase. Ughhh this was not going to be fun. On the trail were a mix of tourists and locals. Some of these locals were using bamboo poles to carry massive amounts of supplies to the top of the mountain. Like seriously multiple cases of water, full propane tanks, etc. After about what felt like 45mins of hiking, we decided to take a break and see if the top was in sight. We seriously couldn’t see it… We decided to ask the others on the road how much longer the hike was. Turns out the hike was actually a 3 hour hike… OMG RYAN lol. It was too late to tour around so we continued onward.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Couple of funny memories: there were locals on the hiking trail about 45mins that were holding stretchers trying to sell the service of carrying someone up the mountain lol. They said in broken english “you know you want” and tried offering a discount from their already outrageous price. Ryan was a bit sick and was not in the best shape so this hike was rough for him, but to his credit, he got all the way to the top. I was dying as well but the random hiking stick I found proved to be super helpful. Connor was leading the pack with what seemed like little trouble.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Along the way and once we got to the top. We took many photos and took a much needed rest <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #51-#58]</span>. Couple memories: The food and drinks sold at the top were super pricey. Totally made sense though. Were going to attempt a hike to a lake on top of the mountain but we were too tired and decided to take the gondola down <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #59 & #60]</span>. There was no way we were hiking back down lol. When we got to the bottom, we got one final picture and ate the rest of our tea eggs before heading back to our Airbnb <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #61 & #62]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The night consisted of grabbing a quick bite to eat, grabbing some beers at the nearby bar, and crashing super earlier. We were all so tired from the full day adventure. The next day, we got one last meal with the aunties we met before heading home <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #63]</span>. We made sure to include one last vlog of Ryan exiting the metro in Shanghai before officially ending our weekend trip. This was the trip that solidified our close tight nit travel squad circle. Time spent with this group was easy, fun, and exciting. Can’t wait for many more adventures to come!

											School was going well. I had seven classes total with my favorites being intermediate Chinese, business management, and my math class. Each of these had specific reasons for being at the top of my list. Intermediate Chinese was full of my best friends, business management had an amazing teacher, and my math class was super easy so it was a delight crushing the course <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #64]</span>.

											One night, I joined a few of my other taiwanese student friends to go eat some traditional taiwanese cuisine <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #65]</span>. Soooo yummy! :) During our time at Fudan, all the exchange students got paired with a buddy so that we could learn from each other. My language buddy seemed nice but was less interested since I wasn’t white lol. I think that is what she expected. Also, we had different goals. She only wanted to speak in English but I mostly wanted to speak in Chinese haha. We got a super yummy spicy beef noodle soup dish though <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #66]</span>!

											Towards the middle of the month, our UCEAP program had another planned trip for us! This time we were going to Jiangsu province to learn more about Chinese culture. I remember Connor wasn’t super excited about this trip and really wanted to be hanging out with our main travel squad instead. Total felt the same way but I also wanted to take advantage of the prepaid trip. First we went to one of the old emperor palaces. One of the first things we witnessed was a reenactment of a famous battle. Because, I know mom is all about dynasty war stuff, I facetimed her <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #67 - #69]</span>!

Thankfully, we had a guide to take us around and explain everything to us. We got to witness another performance reenactment of royalty and their traditions. After this, it was for my favorite part….. Lunch time! We got so much yummy food, once again family style <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #73 & #74]</span>. It took everything for me not to eat everything on the table haha.

											Once we were done with this, we headed to our hotel and checked in for the night. It was actually a really nice place. Connor and I shared a room which was chill afff. We all retired for the night for the next day's adventure to the Spring Temple of Lushan to see the giant golden buddha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The next morning consisted of an early start, a quick breakfast, and van ride to Lushan. Our van dropped us off at a village near the entrance of the spring temple. It was here that we explored the area and partook in a calligraphy lesson <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #75 & #76]</span>. Honestly, I sucked at it but it was a whole lot of fun. Once we were done exploring the village near the entrance to the temple, we started our trek to the golden buddha. There was a beautiful water ceremony near the entrance of the spring temple <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #77]</span>. Funny memory: I remember that I kept on trying to take a video of the cool part of the water ceremony but kept stopping the video once it got good haha. I was trying to save storage space. Oh well.

											Next stop was the golden buddha. It was massive! OMG. We got tons of pictures and a gorgeous panorama of the surrounding landscape <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #78 - #83]</span>. I got to touch the large toe of the giant golden buddha. Apparently, this would bring good luck and fortune into my life. Nice! After this we dined at the temple cafeteria on sight. It was a buffet but full of only vegetarian dishes lol. Some of us were disappointed but honestly, the food was tasty. We ended the day with a full 360 degree screening performance. Super cool. What a great trip!

											While in China, dad and Ahma came to visit me for a few weeks. It was actually nice to see him but he still hadn’t seemed to change much. One thing that did not change was his enjoyment of food; which I was not opposed to. We had so many amazing dishes from nice restaurants in the area. We had so much seafood, dim sum dishes, and fancy foods <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #84 - #90]</span>.

											Another fancy food occasion that I had was with Kevin at a michelin star restaurant called Bo Shanghai. Apparently, it was the sister restaurant of a three michelin star restaurant. It was located at the Bund and overlooked the beautiful downtown Shanghai landscape. When we first got there, we hung out at the bar area waiting to be let in. Once the restaurant was ready, we were ushered in through a secret entrance! OMG it was soooo cool!

											The dining room was beautiful! There were tons of wooden tables and candles everywhere. We were seated at a table and were handed menus. As we were sitting there, I noticed a table in front of the chefs. I had never been to a super fancy michelin restaurant before so my unaware ass asked the waitress if we could sit there instead. Yah… That was the chef’s table lol. The waitress was so nice, talked to the chefs, and was actually able to accommodate us! Woooohoooo! The chef introduced themselves and got us started with our meal. They were the ones to walk us through the menu omg. So lucky that this all worked out haha. We had a variety of dishes that featured either an interesting technique, rare ingredient, and defined purpose <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #91 - #107]</span>. Every dish wowed me. After the meal, I made sure to get a picture with the chefs and our wonderful waitress <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #108]</span>! What a wonderful experience.
