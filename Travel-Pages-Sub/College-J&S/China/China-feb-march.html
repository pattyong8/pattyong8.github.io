											This study abroad opportunity was one of the most defining moments in my college career. Not only did I
											get to explore more of myself and family culture, I also immensely improved my Mandarin and made some
											amazing new friends. It strangely enough felt like I was at home and fit right in. I think this was
											due to my childhood exposure to Chinese/Taiwanese culture. Most of the friends I made were from other
											countries outside of China and helped create a study abroad adventurous environment. Thank goodness
											Connor and I went together because it allowed me to try new things knowing that I always had a homie
											by my side. So glad I gutted up and went abroad. So many amazing memories and experiences to last a
											lifetime.

											<h2>Arrival & Orientation</h2>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											While on the plane to China, I experienced a number of different feelings: excitement, worry, and anxiety amongst others. This was going to be the first time in my life where I ventured for more than a month outside the safety of my home in California. I was traveling to a foriegn land without my family or much guidance. There were many unknowns but I could feel the excitement building. Thankfully, I was studying abroad with my good friend Connor. Having him there provided the bit of confidence I knew I would need to blossom as a person, student, and growing adult.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Landing and figuring out how to get to my new apartment was interesting. My Mandarin was okay since I grew up listening to my parents speak to each other. I started talking with the Taxi driver and asked him about all the good food around, places to visit, and weather; all things I knew how to say. I got to my apartment and figured out the room situation. Connor and I decided to double, which was a great call, so we could pay lower rent. Because I got there before Connor I got to choose my bed first, though it didn’t really matter all that much. I had the place all to myself and got settled in.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The next morning, I woke up and went to explore the surrounding area. I walked to a mall called Wujiaochang. It was a massive collection of around four buildings. It was actually here that I got my first meal; a shaobing made in a hot oven <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1 & #2]</span>. Soooo yummy! I also went to go figure out my phone card and bank account since this was a priority being in a different country. I had to call my mom and ask her to translate for the more complicated stuff lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Connor arrived that night! Fischer also arrived sometime during the day. It was so great to have a familiar face there and another Cal student. Fischer had already been to China once so he decided to take us to the Bund that night for a celebratory drink. We ended up going to a rooftop bar and got a few beers <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. After the beers, we went back and got ready for the next official study abroad orientation day.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The orientation went well! I found myself being more extroverted during the session. I forced myself to meet a ton of new people and ended up making friends quite quickly. One of the first people I met was a guy named Wyatt. He was from Australia and we ended up meeting a number of other australians as well such as Jake and Antonia. Our other friends included Magnus, Ryan, Kevin, Sebas, Essi 1, Essi 2, Trine, Nanna, Francois, Jaako, Kristina, and Timo <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. The Fudan organizers planned a dumpling making session for us which was super fun! Since I had experience making them, I was kinda pumping them out haha <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #5 & #6]</span>.

											We actually hit it off so well that I started coordinating a night out with everyone we met. We ended up inviting everyone back to our apartment and had a pregame before heading out to propaganda for the night. Omg this was such a fun night! We got smashed with everyone and made a ton of new friends very quickly <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>. Propaganda was great as well. Since we were Americans, we got free drinks lol. They also let us in for free. The interesting part was that anyone who looked asian, like myself, needed to be with other white friends in order to get the wristband denoting you as the free entry/free drink customer. This was also the night that I met Kevin. Did some interesting things that night haha.

											We had our first UCEAP Trip! Woooohooo! I was mostly excited because there would be free food at nice restaurants lol. We started the day at the Oriental Tower. Our program got us tickets to go to the top! We got a ton of great photos of the entire experience <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #8 - #12]</span>. Connor and I got a super sick photo at the top. After this, we went to the city god temple, a tourist attraction with a temple in the middle of a pond. There were so many restaurants, tourist attractions, and shops. We even got to enter into the tea gardens! I remember getting a large Xiaolongbao and exploring the area with Connor <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #13 - #16]</span>. We also got lunch after this event. So many great food items all served family style :).

											School didn’t start until the second week we got there so there was a ton of time to get situated and learn about the city we were in. Few memories: Kevin and I went to go eat the spicy Sichuan fish dish at Wujiaochang <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #17]</span>. Our newly formed friend group went out a ton before school started. One of our favorite spots was a club called TAXX. We didn’t have to pay to get in because of promoters and also got free alc. We assumed the alc was fake and not the best for us. This place was a full on night club with blaring music, tables, and wonderful DJs <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #18 & #19]</span>.

											Hilarious memory… On one of these nights out. We were all hanging out after one of our club outings and walking through the city of Shanghai. Antonia was drunk and Connor ended up accidentally pushing her in a bush. Because she was not 100%, she had such a hard time getting out of the bush LOL <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #20 & #21]</span>. Adding on to this memory, Anonita came to live with us in our place! That was sooo amazing because I loved having her at our place. Also, she adopted a squirrel named Shushu. I thought it was annoying but everyone else loved it haha.

											Eventually our completely free days and nights were up. School started and we immediately were thrown into unfamiliar territory yet again, we had to figure out our classes, rooms, and teachers all at once <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #22 - #24]</span>. Memory: I had to work extra hard to make sure all the classes I was taking would end before I had to leave for my internship in Seattle with Amazon. Another interesting memory: in the first couple of weeks we went to get a gym membership, turns out the school gym was far and kinda sucked. We found a much nicer gym with an indoor pool closer to our place. We brought all our friends and were able to negotiate a better rate. This was such an interesting experience. I was kinda seen as the liaison between everyone and the manager.

											Our travel squad decided to go on a day trip to Hangzhou. Because mom and Vincent were visiting then, I decided to take them with me! It would be so fun and mom knew the place. Apparently, one of her student’s family wanted to take us out to lunch as well! We were separate from the travel squad until after lunch. Once we met up with them we explored the man made lake <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #25 - #27]</span>. According to mom, this lake is usually extremely beautiful but it was unfortunately overcast when we were there. We got to a vantage point and had Kevin do a taekwondo kick on a water bottle. Fun memories include: Antonia and I doing a jumping photo, group photo at the vantage point, not taking the ferry and instead walking over the man made water bridge.

											After getting back from Hangzhou, my family and I traveled to Beijing! We got to see, experience, and discover so many amazing places. After arriving in Beijing, we learned that the air quality was TERRIBLE like the worst in the world at the time. This did not stop us. Mom had one of her student’s mom take us around the summer palace and forbidden city <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #28 - #33]</span>. Memories, our hotel had three beds! So perfect! Although the air quality was bad, we still went out at night to get food and such.

											Mom had so many connections with her students that a number of our meals were taken care of by these families. We went to a super famous peking duck restaurant where each duck comes with a certificate and a hotpot place <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #34 - #38]</span>. Each of these meals were fully paid for.

											One of the days in Beijing was specifically reserved to go see the Great Wall of China <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #39 - #41]</span>! OMG it was huge and absolutely amazing. It literally went on forever. We got up early that morning to go. Funny memories: Vincent and I shotguns beers on the wall, the carbonation was too much though so we both ended up throwing up the beer over the wall XD, mom specifically brough t-shirts with UCI and Berkeley for us to wear while on the wall, I got a funny picture of Vincent looking like he fell over the Great Wall and I was helping him up. The last thing we did in Beijing was to go see the Olympic training center. We really only drove past but it was cool to see <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #42]</span>.

											After Beijing, we headed back to Shanghai for a couple of days before my family had to leave. During this time we explored Fudan University, the Bund, and had tons of great food  <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #43 - #46]</span>! Couple of great memories: since my family visited during my birthday, we were able to go out clubbing and they even surprised me with a cake with all my friends back at my apartment! I think Kevin grabbed the cake but my mom and brother coordinated with Connor to get everyone together. Vincent almost missed his flight because we went to TAXX the night before. He was so hungover lol. Mom loved the food so much and I don’t blame her. We went to the goof xiaolongbao place at least 5 times while they visited haha.
