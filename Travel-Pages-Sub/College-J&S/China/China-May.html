											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got up at 5:30 to make an early train to Kaohsiung. At the rice in bamboo leaf thing and some fish miso soup. We left for the train. Started with the same old bus and takes us to the MRT. On the MRT, I tried to sleep but couldn’t get myself to haha. It was just super uncomfortable for my neck. I saw a few cute guys on the MRT. We finally got off the MRT after attempting to fall asleep on it. We transitioned to the main Taipei train station. Dad bought his own breakfast and we then went and waited for our train on the waiting chairs right inside of the outdoor station part. Dad noticed a guy from the Asian talk show where they talk about their own experience being married to an Asian spouse. This was the show that dad always watched at home. Very colorful show that I thought was comedy based.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once that guy left, we moved onto the train. Lots of people for a Sunday morning! I feel asleep for an hour before waking up. I decided to update dad’s phone because there was WiFi on the train and we would be on it for a while. Once we got to the station, we realized that dad’s phone was requiring a pin to reunlock the SIM card. We couldn’t figure out the issue, so we were without a phone for the first part of the trip. Dad bought some food and drinks in the train station before we left for agong as an offering. We took the MRT close to the temple and then taxied the rest of the way. The weather was good and there was no rain <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Our first stop was at the 2nd floor with the name plate. Agong’s was 217. We also talked to dad’s grandparents. Dad did most of the talking for everyone, but I talked to agong individually. I told him that I am sorry I missed his funeral because I was working at Amazon. I also told him that I was starting to work for Accenture. Also wished for good fortune for mom, my brother, and dad. Then we moved on to the 5th floor where agong’s actual ashes were stored. Dad unlocked it with a key, and we talked to him as well. One of the people that work there noticed I had a hat on and told me to take it off. I felt very embarrassed.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Dad then used two coins as a replacement for the moon shaped fortune question telling thing. We were not allowed to say bye to agong or see you next time. Just had to stop talking as we left. Once we were done, dad wanted to go read the scripture with agong, ago, and his grandparents. We took the food back as well. We ran our way to the main desk area to call for a taxi, since it was raining and because dad’s phone wasn’t working. They called a taxi. Before the taxi, we made our way into the main temple area and said a last-minute prayer before they closed. The taxi arrives and we hopped in it. Dad asked to be taken to the China Unicom place, but the taxi driver told him that it was closed on Sundays.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Dad still wanted to see for himself, typical, so we went there before going to the tea shop to get mom’s dad a thing of nice tea. Very nice of dad to think about that. We also stopped at a random hotel so that dad could call China telecom and ask for their pin. Honestly, I’m not sure if they even helped since I’m pretty sure we figured it out by ourselves. After this, we walked the rest of the way to the hotel that dad said to meet Agong at. It was actually cool because I recognized a lot of the places we passed by the Costco, the temple, the love river, etc. I crossed the street and dad went to do his own thing. I went into the hotel and waiting inside of the air-conditioned lobby for Agong.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											As I was sitting there, someone came up to me. It was my cousin Charles! I said hit to him and made small talk until Agong go to the hotel. Charles also funny enough asked about the US China trade war. Def not an expert but I tried my best. As we were talking on this subject, Agong walked in so we immediately got up and followed him. In about 5 second, he turned around and saw us! We went into the all you can eat buffet. I kept telling Agong no, but he refused and said we must eat there. Wow it was good. I got so much shrimp tempura, sashimi, and meat. OMG, I kept sending snaps to mom. I even FaceTimed her at one point to say hi to agong and showed her that I was eating so many amazing desserts <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. 🤪
											</p>

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I also ate ice cream, cheesecake, and other amazing desserts 😋. At the end of the meal, I brought the entire table oolong tea as a gesture of politeness. My mamma taught me well! During the lunch, Charles and I talked about work life balance difference between China and the US, the trade war, and told Agong that I wanted to interview him later. The trade war was such a topic of interest to Charles because he was writing a school paper on it. Agong agreed to do the interview! We left the restaurant. Agong only had to pay half price because he is old!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We walked to the Toyota RAV car and drove to their home. Their home is actually quite nice with a view. I do remember the house, but it was nice to visit again. I saw the room that mom said was her room. Very nice. I was about to start interviewing Agong after figuring out the filing details with Charles but Agong wanted to take a nap. We let him. His napping spot was actually on a massage chair lol. Super funny to watch him sleep like that. There was a fan directly above where the head was in the chair. The massage was one of the full body ones. Agong eventually got up. I was just playing on my phone before then. Agong got up and we started after I put a glass of tea in-front of him.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											My first question was very general and just asked about his childhood. What I did understand was that he was referring to the era where Japan controlled Taiwan and then when China took it back. I also understood the part where he talked about going to school in Thailand. My second question was about his marriage and doctor year. I didn’t understand much but I’ll have mom translate later. I then let Charles ask a question. His question was about his dad. I didn’t understand or really listen to much of it because the recording stopped. We really should have used 720 and not 1080. My second to last question was about his life’s biggest mistake and what he learned from it. I’ll have mom translate later.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The last question was a favorite quote or saying. I didn’t really understand, and I’ll ask mom to translate. Then we ended. I gave agong a hug and transferred the files to Charles. He said he would send it over via zip file later. Then we left for chwa bing. Super yummy! I got what mom usually gets. Then agong drove me to the big market where I could meet dad. After getting dropped off and say by to agong I met up with dad. Before I left, I made sure to tell agong I would visit again soon with mom and that I loved the time I spent with him. I even offered Charles the open invitation to contact me if he moves to the US.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Met dad in the large market. We walked over to a hotpot place that only has fresh meat cut for their hotpot <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. The meat has never been frozen <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. It was honesty really good. I was very surprised. At first, I didn’t think it was that great. It started to grow on me. I then realized that dad had bought some sort of hard alc/sake. Didn’t think of it at the time but it was foreshadowing what I will later mention. I had a ton of fun with dad. Showed him all the pictures I had from graduation and my climbing trip. He seems to like it. Dad’s battery was running out, so I plugged his phone into the wall outlet. We decided to have a chill day tomorrow. Lots of errands and possibly watch the Spider-Man movie later. Also, made him promise to go to a climbing gym with me.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Left this hotpot place. Dad seemed to know the people in the store. I also started to pretend to be a bad ass. Turned my hat backwards and pretended my toothpick was a cig. Lol so not me but whatever. I was being goofy. Dad stated to talk about a bathhouse and sleeping in it after getting a massage. Honestly it didn’t sound that great and I tried to say I didn’t want to do it. Dad wasn’t getting the hint and that’s when I started to realize he was drunk. We will see how the rest of the night turns out. We got on the train and were about to go to our seats but as we passed by the first-class seating, I had the idea of sitting there and trying it out. We entered the car and got to sit down. Then, we ran into trouble when the lady came by asking for drinks. My dumb self-asked for a drink and got too greedy. She then checked her seating chart and realized we didn’t belong in first class. Oh well, at least we tried.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We went back to our actual seats. There is a crying baby here 🙄 Dad is sleeping and DEF drunk because he is snoring loudly and smells like alcohol. That is always a telltale sign. He is snoring loudly, the baby is crying loudly, and the parent’s way to keep it entertained/quite is by squeezing a very loud and obnoxious rubber toy. Gonna try and catch some Z’s on this train now. Finally, the baby got off the train. We stayed on for one more stop. Got off the train and started running for the last station. Made it just in time. While in the train, I saw the same soccer team I had seen earlier. Tbh the guys were def cute. Now we just sat there until we got to our last stop. Then we got into a taxi to go home. It was definitely cheaper than the other night because the distance was shorter. Got home and immediately went to sleep. I’m glad we didn’t have to go to that bathhouse thing. I really didn’t want to do it. Okay so now I’m home. We grabbed water at 7-11 before getting home. Dad tried to wake me up to put on the patch for my ankle. Lol he didn’t do it in a subtle manner.
											</p>

											<h2>Day 12</h2>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											Got up and started working on the budget. Dad waited for me to finish my budget and then we left with a’ma coming down later. Our first stop was the phone store. Dad got Apple’s number, which we didn’t have to go to the phone store for and gave them a ring. He tried too many times this morning so hopefully the Apple gal can help later tonight around 8. I started to figure out the space issue with my phone. Omg it was annoying. Wasn’t able to find out how to delete the two videos off of iCloud. Tonight, I will try and delete them online through iCloud.com on a computer. I also decided to update my phone. I was hoping it would clear up some storage space.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After the Apple place, we got boba and took the bus to the bank. Dad was very nice and pulled out $500 worth of Thailand Bhat. This will be plenty to cover expenses and go around. He didn’t trust me carrying it in my backpack, so he took it back. After the bank we went to a watch store. The first watch store tried to rip us off. The guy was telling us that many repairs were needed and that it would cost around $5,000 NT. Such a rip off. Omg. I’m glad we were smart enough not to do this. Then we started to stroll around and look for another watch shop. A’ma thankfully asked a local person for a good place to go. After dad and I went to the restroom in 7-11, we met up with her and went to the place.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											This watch/clock shop was quite small and was a mix between a watch shop and mini food stand deli. There were two couples. The watch repair maintenance guy was quite short and appeared to have growing issues. When we asked the guy about the watch I was getting, he said that there was nothing wrong with it! Omg, the other people we have been seeing have been trying to scam us! My dad told him to maintain it anyways so that it would be fine for the next 2-3 years. I went to join a’ma outside as she drank some intestine soup and I ate a pork belly Bao zi.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Started walking to the metro. I wanted to stop at a department store just to figure out what I wanted to do. This is because the day that I thought I would be having wasn’t on dad’s agenda. Although he had agreed to a relaxing day running errands and just hanging out, he instead filled the day with things to do in the city of Taipei. I don’t think he knows how to slow down. I mean this in a bad way. After some thought, I decided to let him have his way and thought it couldn’t be that bad anyways. A’ma went to the restroom. We got on the train.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											When we got on the train, we sat on the sunny side. At first, I didn’t mind but then it got too hot. Needed to move. Our first stop was at a temple <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. This is apparently one of the biggest temples in Taipei. People were chanting which was cool. I got it on film. Next, we walked through a park where I saw many old people playing Chinese chess. I have no idea how they were able to just hang around outside. It was tooooo hot! Then we walked through an alley full of vendors selling herbs. Dad wanted to get some herb drinks, but I told him it wasn’t worth the cost. Instead, we went underground to find a haircut place. The area didn’t look that great, so we decided to go somewhere else and maybe even deal with it on another day.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Took the metro to the “Lincoln of Taiwan” memorial <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. When walking to hit, we passed by tons of younger people practicing hip hop/r&b dancing. Tbh, some of the guys were attractive and shirtless 🤣. We walked around the corner and found ourselves in front of the memorial. We went inside and walked around the exhibit. After we exited, we were just in-time for the flag lowering ceremony. Super cool to watch in person. After this, we hung out in the courtyard area. I drank some water, charged my phone, and watched some families play with foam airplanes. This seemed to be a place people go to hangout. After taking a break, we started walking to Taipei 101. Noah paid me back for Japan! 💸💸💸. We passed by the movie poster for Spider-Man Far From Home. Went to the theater and bought tickets for 7/4/19 at 5:20pm. Got some great seats. Super excited!!!!! We also got a Spider-Man hand drinking cup 😂. I also sent a Snapchat to a ton of friends saying that Tom Holland is my celebrity crush lol.

											Then we took a taxi to a super yummy Japanese yaki Tori place <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. So yummy! Halfway through the meal, dad went to talk to the Apple employee to find out how to login to his Apple account. Went out to ask him how it was going. He has been locked out for the last few days. No luck at the moment but there is still promise since they are sending a new email to his new email account. Came back in and finished the food. Then, we went to walk around the area. Dad went to look at a few watches and then we started to head home upon my request. Anyways, we got off the train and went to the market. Honestly, I just tried to tag along and have a good attitude, but he just wanted to do his own thing. Whatever, I’ll just let him be his own person.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I decided to leave him alone after this. Went to go talk to a’ma instead. It’s actually been very fun talking to a’ma. I have to “play” charades a bit and improvise when talking in Chinese to get more complicated meaning across. I don’t use google translate and instead try my best to piece phrases together to create a sentence. This could either be a good or bad thing… Good because I am forcing myself to practice something. Bad because I am not really learning the right way. Instead, I am just struggling with the wrong way. Oh well haha. Maybe I will use Google translate next time. I think that my journaling is annoying dad. He doesn’t know what I am doing as I furiously typing away. Haha. Oh well, he will never get to know. We got home! Got some water from family mart before going up. Just got done showering, dad is acting like nothing happened sheesh. Anyways, going to sleep now 😴

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got up. Actually, decided to have a chill day this time. Started off by looking for a used phone store. We looked all over kaohsiung. Couldn’t find one. Went to the watch shop. Picked up the watch I will be using. Found a pinkish dot on day #2 that shows days. The watch guy said there was nothing he could do about it. Must have come when the manufacture made it. Yay new watch! Then went to Costco. Omg dad got me a new iPhone 10S MAX. This is literally the most expensive phone that money can buy. We spent about an hr at Costco mulling over the phones and deciding what to get. Why did he buy it for me? Well he said it was a graduation present and that I am his son.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I honestly have a feeling that he had his mom pay for it. She is the one that paid for it at the cash register. He also had to sit down with her for 10mins to talk before we got the phone. Yah I’m sure he told her to buy it for me as a grad present. She is very nice to have agreed. 😁 I have a new iPhone 10 now! When I first got it, I was in disbelief. Then, I transitioned into happiness and joy! 😁😁😁 We left, paid for parking and we’re on our way. Quick note, dad found it hard to find parking using the lights and such. That’s was def funny and frustrating. Made sure to say thank you to a’ma multiple times. She wants to see later if iPhone 10 pics are actually better. Yes they are lol. I’ll show her later...
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We stopped by a goose restaurant and decided to bring a ton of it home <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. When getting out of the car, dad came to my side of the car and we shared an umbrella. He didn’t want me to go in the rain. How nice. Might have also had something to do with rainwater not being good in Taiwan. We got a ton of stuff at the goose restaurant. Omg it all looked soooooo good. Got back into the car and handed a’ma the food. We started to drive back. While on the drive home. I started to update/transfer all of my data to the new iPhone. Omg it is sooo cool.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got home and was thinking about going to Starbucks to start updating/transferring stuff to the phone. This is because dad wanted to plate all the duck nicely. Typical. I decided not to because plating wasn’t going to take that long. Eventually dad was done and we started to eat. We also had beer. There was wing, leg, liver, intestine, and blood rice cake. Oooo so yummy. Ahhhh! I liked the leg meat without bones the most. Not a huge fan of the liver. After I was done. Dad gave me the okay to get up, shower, and get ready to go figure out the phone situation at Starbucks. When I told a’ma. She was kinda against me doing this. Said I couldn’t get up until everyone was done. I mean, this makes sense. I’m just not use to it. Dad told her not to worry about it and gave me permission to get up. I took that as an official green light and got up. A’ma also got up. Not sure if she was mad or something.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Anyhow, I took a shower and then went to Starbucks. While I was there, I realize I had forgotten dad’s laptop. I called a’ma, who was in the shower, and told her to tell dad to bring his laptop. I was able to upload all my stuff to the new phone and back up dad’s phone to his laptop! Internet was slow and I could only use one device for dad’s account. Went home and ate half of a guava and some more duck with dad. Went to sleep.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got up around 10 and went to Starbucks. At Starbucks I finished my sync and dad’s. So we both got new phones! Went back home to get a’ma. Took the bus to the area with watches and what not. A’ma stopped at the bank and HTC. Dad and I went to the watch guy again. Gave him two more watches. The guy that would have ripped us off would have charged 600NT. The one we are currently at fixed the watch for free in 5mins. Went to go find a good place to eat. Couldn’t find the original one. Instead, we went to a water dumpling and noodle place. It was very yummy. Honestly, there were so many different kinds of dumplings. There was an original, curry, Japanese kimchi, Shepard’s purse, shrimp “wanton” like, and an original one. I’d love to try and make a curry one at home at some point.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Left this place and checked out the haircut place <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. She had a 30min wait so we waited. Went to look at baggage and phone cases. All of them were too expensive. Decided to go to silin to find one instead. Met up with a’ma. Left here at the department store with uniqlo near the MRT.  Stopped at the bag place that dad got his swim trunks fixed at and showed dad the backpacking bag I was looking at. Felt pretty cheap and not that great honestly. No metal framing and I wasn’t sold on the color. Decided to keep looking around.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went to the haircut place. First got a hair wash and massage. Super nice omg. It was actually so nice haha. Then I got seated at the hair station and the lady came by. She was super nice. At the beginning dad tried to tell her everything. I eventually was able to convince him to let her do what she thought was best. Got a great haircut! She was super nice and took her time (almost an 1hr long). She styled my hair and really paid attention to it. I think it was because dad could speak Chinese and was keeping conversation going. Also, the fact that we were playfully bickering at the beginning def broke the ice. I got another head massage! This one was a bit longer and I almost fell asleep haha. The girl giving me the massage tried to make conversation with me, but I didn’t understand. That felt a bit awkward. I told her I wanted to talk but just wasn’t able to understand.
											</p>

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went back to the haircut station. Got some weird bengay feeling thing in my hair. Also, the lady told me I had to take care of my hair. They told me to use good shampoo and blow dry my hair. Maybe I’ll start doing that when I get back. Left very happy with my haircut. We went straight to the silin night market. Very beautiful and vibrant for a Tuesday night. First stop was boba <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>! There were three different stores all right next to eat other! Omg, once again, the competition amazes me... We stopped at quite a few phone case/accessory places. All of them were too expensive and I wasn’t very happy with the price or choice. Next we saw a baggage shop. There were a good variety of backpacking bags there. I was very tempted to get one there and then decided to hold off and see if I could find a better deal somewhere else.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then we found a smaller phone repair shop and let a’ma talk to the guy. A’ma was able to fix the phone for cheap! Only $20 US! This must be good. Then we started to walk around looking for other bags. Went to a jipai place that is pretty famous in the silin night market. Super huge piece of chicken <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>! Dad pointed out that there were bones in the chicken. This shows that it’s a real piece of chicken and a white piece at that. It was super-duper crispy and yummy. Kept walking around looking for an accessories place. Decided to go to the Apple reseller place. We got 20% off the case! Omg that’s good.  Then we went back to the big iPhone accessory place near the temple where a’ma was to get the screen protector.
											</p>

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then we went into a Nike shop and I put on the case and screen protector. A’ma and dad kept the sales agent entertained. Yay, I have a new phone and brand-new protection! After this, dad decided to go back to the bag place again to ask for the lowest possible price. The guy said 26000 NT. I still think that is too much, so we decided to wait and keep looking over the next couple of days. After this, we decided to start heading back. Dad wanted to stop at another night market to see what they had. We got off the MRT. I made the joke with a’ma that we weren’t heading home. I’ve noticed that I am able to joke around with a’ma now. We can actually communicate on a basic level now. Hopefully, I’ll get better later in life.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The second night market was only okay. Wasn’t a huge fan. Very small and not a lot to see or eat. Dad explained to me that every district has their own night market. We got a’ma and actually headed home this time. Got home and hung out for a little. Got to try dad’s avocado, tomato, salsa, mix. Wasn’t half bad honestly. Also, ate a ton of fruits. Went to sleep to get ready for the next day.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											Woken up around 11am. Went downstairs with a’ma first to Mos burger. Dad wanted to take a shower.  I met a’ma at Mos burger. Honest it didn’t look that great, so I didn’t get anything.  Went to Starbucks instead and chatted with fam and Davis. By fam I mean mom and told Davis that he needs to think about packing, money, cards, etc. Met up with a’ma again and went into the Starbucks to wait for dad. Dad showed up. We went to the bus station. Dad decided to take the longer bus. There were two very annoying kids on the bus. One was a girl that was constantly yelling at the top of her voice. No constraint haha. The other was a kid boy that couldn’t sit still in his seat. Both parents didn’t do a good job of managing their children. The boy’s mom slapped him and kept yelling at him. The girl’s dad or brother was just doing nothing.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Anyways, we finally got to the station. Needed to refill my card. A’ma gave me 100NT. A’ma said her head was hurting. Went to the restroom. Met dad on the second floor. Dad gave a’ma Advil for her head. On the MRT, dad was telling me that he wanted me to tell Vincent about him. How dad has lost weight and is a better person. Currently on the train. Sitting across from a smelly, fat, and dirty guy. Not sure what his story is. He’s sleeping. A kid went to go sit next to him and seemed iffy on doing so. Saw a really cute guy on the train. Darker skinned Asian. Black hat and white shirt. I think he was trying to dress bad ass which was kinda hot haha.  We got off and went to a place to eat. It was a super popular seafood place! Very big portions and very cheap price for US.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Right next to it was a donut shop. Very sweet and yummy. I had half of it haha. At the sushi place dad got me a sushi bowl with tuna, scallop, sweet shrimp, Uni, okra, yamaimo, beans, halibut, sweat weed, egg thing, fish eggs, salmon, yellow tail, crab, red snapper <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. We also got miso soup with fish in it, fried rice with mini shrimp, and a pan-fried fish. Then we went to the street with many luggages. Was just looking around. Didn’t find anything that I particularly liked. We decided that I would go check the Shilin street again. That bag just seemed way nicer. Still debating whether I need it or not. I think it would be nice to have but also might be something I never use. Left the luggage place and decided to do shilin station instead. Next we went to Taipei 101 to see if a’ma was right about it being free. It wasn’t. A’ma kept looking at the prices of the coffee and tea.

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went to the movie theater area. Found our theater <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. Went into the main area to grab a bite and hangout before the movie. Dad and I went to the family mart and got some water and the dried fish snack for the theater.  Left family mart and got myself a froyo w/ Mochi. When I got to the 2nd floor, I let a’ma try a little of my yogurt. Went up to the 2nd floor and got Burger King. I tried their fries and dad tried their fried chicken nuggets. The fries were okay. We asked for it with no salt so that we could get fresh ones. The chicken was only okay. Met up with a’ma again. She said the person next to her noticed that I shared my yogurt with her and called her pretty. The person next to a’ma said I was very sweet, and they started to make conversation. They exchanged contacts on Line. They now have a connection into downtown Taipei if they want haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got popcorn and soda. A’ma and I went to the restroom beforehand. I didn’t wait for a’ma when I finished and went straight to where dad was. A’ma came wondering over and got a tiny bit mad that I didn’t wait for her. It wasn’t that she was actually mad. She was just nagging. I told her sorry and we moved on. Went to the movie. Waited for about 2 mins before getting in. Omg the movie was great! Obvi it was Spider-Man far from home. It was a bit loud. I was a bit worried about it being too loud for a’ma. I guess it was alright since she enjoyed it. Dad enjoyed it as well. I thought it was great! A little cheesy with the love scene parts tbh. [MOIVE SPOLIER ALERT!!!] The plot was so intense! It just changed dramatically when mysteryo became the bad guy. Omg! The ending was also insane. I have no idea how the next Spider-Man will turn out now that his identity is public knowledge.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Left the theater and went to ding tai fung. Omg that was almost as amazing as the Spider-Man movie. Such good food at the first ever ding tai <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. A’ma and I drank a lot of tea<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. I observed that many people who just got off work came with their colleagues here to drink and eat. Wow. Before going in, dad snuck away to get alcohol. I know him too well haha. He thinks I’m oblivious to his drinking problem sometimes lol. Then, we walked a couple stores down and got a thin noodle soup thing. Dad said it was famous. Honestly, it was really good haha. Super small portions and honestly not worth it but so yummy. Then went to shilin and went to the original backpack shop.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Looked at the 1st backpack I saw the first time. Honestly, it still looks like the best option, but I really had to think if it was worth it. Tbh, it was quite big and bulky. Could look weird and might not fit all situations well. If anything, I think it’ll get great value for the rest of my trip. Super happy with the purchase. Both dad and a’ma seemed to like it as well. Dad is being very nice buying all these things for me. I like the color of the bag, the material, and the extra space. I know it will come handy in the future.  Stopped at a phone shop before going home to get a phone back ring. Modeled the backpack for a’ma and dad on the way home. They thought the color looked good. I tried to kick in the air while waiting for the train and felt ankle pain when I did it. I honestly think I either brushed for mini fractured my ankle. Oh well lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got on one of the last trains back home. Won’t make the second train for the final leg but it’s fine. On the way back I could tell dad was getting drunker. Also, when we got back, he wasn’t really listening clearly and was talking to a’ma about how she doesn’t know what to do about transportation at night because she doesn’t go out then. I told a’ma not to talk to him because he is drunk. Tried to tell her there was no use in talking to him when he is drunk because he talks a lot. I think a lot of it was lost in translation. So dad is still def an alcoholic. The fact that he needs to sneak off to get alcohol and can’t restrain himself means that he still has a problem and is still def an alcoholic. Super sad but there isn’t much I can do at this point. Sigh. Hopefully, he learns soon else his liver won’t be able to handle much more of this. Got in a taxi once we got off the train. Got off the taxi and went inside to dad’s place. I took a shower and hung out for a bit. Then went to sleep. Watched a bit of YouTube before falling asleep.
