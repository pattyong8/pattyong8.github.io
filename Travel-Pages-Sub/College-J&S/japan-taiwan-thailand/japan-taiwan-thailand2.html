											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up around 11am and headed to the train station to go back to Tokyo. Once we got to the train station, we were hungry, so we got some ramen. It was alright and soy sauce based. Once we got on the train, we decided to take a short nap. We were lucky enough to get two seats next to each other. After we woke up, we tried to cross reference our own ‚Äúowe money‚Äù lists. Neither of us were detailed enough in our descriptions, so it was hard to cross reference. I decided to do it later in Taiwan and just sent the list to Noah.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I was also playing the dinosaur card game on my phone. To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt fun, but I wanted to pass the time while on the train. After we got to Tokyo, we decided to go to the climbing gym called b-pump <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. The fee was quite expensive because we had to pay the one time initiation/registration fee. Total was $30+ per person! However, the gym was worth seeing. The climbs were soooo hard. Like honestly way harder than gyms in the US. I had to stick to the V0-V1 boulders. Those climbs felt like V4-V6 at home haha. We met a guy named Zach from Utah who was in his 2nd month in Tokyo training for the Olympics. Noah spent a ton of time with him and even tried some competition boulders.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I wasn‚Äôt good or strong enough to do any of the harder climbs. Somehow after our bouldering session I got injured from stepping off the matt without looking. I was an idiot and sprained my ankle pretty bad. Honestly, it was the most pain I had been in after a sprain. Literally rolled on the ground for 30 seconds. I was surprised that none of the Japanese climbers asked me if I was okay or gave me any attention at all. I stopped climbing right away and elevated + iced my ankle. I was almost going to start climbing again lol. Because of my decision, I think it helped heal my ankle a lot quicker.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We left the gym and got some money back because we only stayed till 6:30pm. Noah helped carry my bags for a bit since my ankle was hurting a lot. How nice of him üôÉ. Noah got McDonald‚Äôs because he wanted to try ‚ÄúJapan‚Äù McDonald‚Äôs lol. As I suspected, he wasn‚Äôt impressed haha. On the way back, we stopped for beers at Vector beer <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. Got gyoza from place next door to pair with Advil in stomach. I then realized it wasn‚Äôt gyoza and was actually Chinese pot stickers. Got to our hostel. It looked very fancy and there were a ton of people.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											First hostel that used an iPad and self-check in. We got our building & door code, took showers, and I elevated and iced for a bit while trying to figure out the receipts I had and then we meet people downstairs. The people we met were amazing! <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span> Cliff is from Singapore and knows how to speak Japanese. Zach has been traveling for 2 years thus far working remotely for a company he runs. Super cool guy and hit is off with Noah. Rebecca is from Scotland, talked a lot, and studied law. Adnan is from the UK and studied law as well. Hassan was another interesting person. Don‚Äôt know much about him. Nicolas randomly met us on the street. He didn‚Äôt stay at our hostel but was super cool and hear us speak English, so he tagged along haha. I talked to him for a while at the JBBQ place we stopped at. He works in SF as a lawyer which is super cool. Is taking a month long break vacation to reflect on his life. Julie is from Canada and is going to work for BCG. We started talking about consulting lol. She gets 6 months off before work to travel and volunteer for an organization. So amazing! üòÅ
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We went to the batting cages and arcade place. Super interesting. People didn‚Äôt know how to bat but that was the fun of it. I decided to try and find food and found nothing that looked good, so I went back without food. Watched the last people play baseball. I played metal slug, Tekken, and some weird levels competition game with a green, red, blue, and gold button. Three people could play at once. Once we left, we all decided to go back to the hostel and end our night around midnight. Hit a 7-11 on the way back and all of us decided to buy 1 random item and share it with the group. I got cream puffs, Noah got sake KitKats, Cliff got the Japanese fermented beans, Rebecca got mint chocolate, Adnan got a vitamin jelly drink, Hassan got mini cracker chocolates, Nicholas got alcohol haha, and Zach got a mini childcare pancake. Noah and I were hungry, so we tried to get ramen at a ramen joint 10mins away but decided within the first 2mins to not do that. Instead, we got food from family mart. Noah and his doubts about the food but I convinced him to do it since I already knew the quality wasn‚Äôt bad. Got back to the hostel, hung-out with the group while we ate and then we turned in for the night. My ankle was feeling better during the night but not 100%.

											<h2>Day 7</h2>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up and thought my ankle was fine. It was not... took an Advil and then realized I had no food in my stomach. Decided to go down to the complimentary breakfast of eggs and bread and had a bit of food. Went back up to the room to finish packing. Once that was done, we decided to go to the fish market. However, we realized that transport to the airport from the market was too long. It would have been too rushed. Instead we decided to stick around the area.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went to the yakitori street but everything was closed. Instead we had a version of yoshinoya and some wonderful soba soup with a vegetable mixed tempura. It was amazing and cheap!!! üòç I also told Noah that I was surprised we traveled so well together. I actually had my doubts since we had never really spent time alone. It had always been groups in Seattle & other trips. I was very happy that it worked out though and that we were compatible travel buddies. üòÅ Maybe we will travel again together in the future. Then we went to a random store, loitered, and used their WiFi to nap my way to the rail station. Gave Noah the rest of my money. About 3,000 yen. Walked him to the store he really wanted to go to and then said our goodbyes <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Did the last hurrah video.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I walked to the station and realized that the map was just making me walk to train 8. I could have actually entered into the subway at any entrance. Got my way onto the train without too much difficulty. Also realized that I gave Noah all the rest of my money that I could have used in Osaka with Davis. Oh well hahah I‚Äôll just pull out 10,000 went we get there. Met two girls that could speak Chinese on the subway. Stuck with them while going to the airport. There was a weird transfer where all three of us were kicked off the train and had to wait 15mins to get on the airport express train. If I had gone to the fish market and hadn‚Äôt met the two other girls, this might have been a very stressful ride to the airport. Even now I still think it‚Äôll be a very tight window.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Made it to the airport. Security was extremely short. Got to chat with mom for a bit before taking off for Taiwan. Got on the plane. Got to watch Taken 3 and Finding Dory on the plane. Both were average movies at best. Was hungry so I asked for two airplane meals. üòÅ Landed in Taiwan, had to wait in a fairly long passport control line (immigration). Tried to enter the first time without a Taiwan address and they sent me back to get it. Had to text dad for it. Eventually got through immigration and customs. As soon as I saw dad, I was very surprised/taken aback. I knew to expect that he would be skinny, but I didn‚Äôt think he would be that skinny. I obviously recognized his face, but his body was completely different. Very skinny. Hugging him was also interesting. Felt like a frail person, not the big bodied father I was used to hugging. He had told me multiple times that he lost a lot of weight, but I didn‚Äôt expect that much to be lost. Good for him.

											</div>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Also saw my grandmother. She now has grey hair. Besides that, she looks the same. Speaking Chinese with her again was very nice. I was able to reconnect and speak a language I felt comfortable speaking. They were both worrying about my foot. I kept telling them it was fine. Thankful I had gone a good job of immediate care. I truly think that is the reason why I am fine. We got into the car which was a very old Mercedes and were off to the night markets. We used Google maps to get to the night markets and it took us through a random alley or two. Dad wasn‚Äôt too happy that we were in a random place and started to get frustrated. Reminded me of how he was back then. I had also noticed that he still would yell at his mom. Somethings never change. üòî Anyways, I helped him direct and everything was fine because I am amazing at giving directions. üòã
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 I also told dad that I wanted to do a day trip to Kaohsiung to see mom‚Äôs dad and his dad. I also, let them know that I didn‚Äôt want to work at Amazon because I wanted to do something different (i.e. Accenture doing consulting). We arrived at the night market and I was immediately hit with memories from when I was a kid <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. The bright lights, bustling people, and myriad of food was a welcoming sight. We found parking at a random gas station for 60 TWD. I got changed into my waterproof shoes, because it was literally pouring and put on pants to avoid mosquitoes.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We walked across the street to the night market. The street we had to cross was quite dangerous as cars didn‚Äôt really yield. Once we got across, my grandmother decided to stay near the outskirt stores. My father and I went into the markets. I immediately got some pictures and sent them to mom. I know she will be jealous haha. Dad took me to a peanut noodle place and stinky tofu place. The stinky tofu was amazing!!! Omg like so amazing. I saw a cockroach right under the table we were sitting at to welcome me to Taiwan üòÇ. No surprises there. Then we went to a famous Michelin recommended Taiwanese sausage stand outside of a temple<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. About a 20min line and the food was just alright. It was a cool experience though. Also, a rat ran under the stall while I was waiting in line. Yet another creature present all over Taiwan that came to greet me. You know the food is good when the rats want it haha.
											</p>

												</div>
											</div>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then we went to an underground food court vibe area. There were a ton of ‚Äúfair‚Äù type games such as popping balloons with darts, shooting balloons with toy guns, and catching fish with a net. At the food court area on the basement floor of some building, we ate soup dumplings üòã. Not the best but still yummy. The inside seems to be like water dumpling insides instead of soup dumpling traditional insides. I was pretty wiped out after that, so we went to go find my grandma and then got in the car. Passing by the same night market, my dad wanted to get some famous fried chicken in which they fry, dip in sauce, and then grill the flattened chicken breast.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we got this snack, which I could not finish, we actually headed to my dad‚Äôs place. The home is by a river and situation in a newer suburban district with high rise apartments. Seems nice enough. It was quite far from the city. Questionable location if someone needs to consistently work in the city. Went into the apartment. All the furniture and stuff from the old flat was in there. There are three rooms. I got to sleep in the study room that also had a mini mattress bed thing. At least there was AC in that room haha. The shower is pretty much just a regular shower. Nothing very special. Dad locks his room every time he leaves the apartment. Shows that he is still as paranoid as before about people being after him/looking through his stuff. Also, they do not have WiFi which is quite annoying, but dad is allowed to use his hotspot which is good. Tried calling mom but she was busy with transfer advising. Will call her tomorrow. I went to sleep and tried to get ready for the next day.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up around 11am and actually got up. Did the ‚ÄúNoah owes‚Äù budget thing on a google excel doc. Will share it with him soon after I finish it. While I was working on it, I was able to call mom and chat about stuff. She said she misses me. I love mom and will give her all the time she wants because she deserves it and means the world to me. She gave so much for me so it‚Äôs my turn to give back. Also called Davis and tried to plan the Thailand trip. Found the flight but wasn‚Äôt able to buy it for some reason. Ughhhhh. They kept denying the credit card. Said we would try later. Left with dad and a‚Äôma to go to downtown Taipei. Lots of transportation is required to get there unfortunately.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											First, we went to the bus stop, sprayed down myself with bug spray, and got on the bus. It was just a bus haha but still kinda cool to see that area where they live. It took us directly to the MRT. The MRT is the massive rapid transport station. Not a fast train but I think it is the main transport system of Taipei. While on the train, a guy was talking very loudly. Dad was getting annoyed so I told him to let the little things in life annoy him. He said it was a good philosophy. Not sure if he will actually adopt it ever. He also asked me to think about inventions or new things in the US that he could introduce to Taiwan and be the supplier for. Not sure if that‚Äôs a good idea haha. He can do him though.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then we took a few more metros to get to our first location. On the way to our first location, I told dad and a‚Äôma that I wanted to interview a‚Äôma about her life and such. She seemed excited that this would be happening. I will give her a few days to mentally prepare and then maybe give her a few questions before hand. We walked through a wholesale fruits and vegetables store and arrived at a very nice sushi market/bar location<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Omg, I‚Äôm not going to lie, I think the sushi was better in this location than in Japan. Given the fish was from Japan but still! It was amazing ü§™. So much expensive and amazing items. Two types of crab, abalone, two types of scallops, raw shrimp, uni, yellow tail, 4 types of tuna, halibut fin, eel, oyster, and clam miso soup <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>.
											</p>
											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											During the meal, a‚Äôma was asking me questions and dad was getting very frustrated with it. I told him that it reminded me of what happened in the past and that he needed to learn how to be nicer. He didn‚Äôt really listen and wanted to forget about it. Typical... I think I‚Äôm done trying to fix him. He‚Äôs better but still the same person. Also, had beer with a sick glass that I took with me haha. I showed it to dad and a‚Äôma when I left. It says be proud of Taiwan and it‚Äôs a Taiwan beer glass. Then we started walking to the temple that I wanted to see. On the way, dad accidentally walked us in a circle haha. Also, he wanted to rent bikes, but I said it wasn‚Äôt worth it. We got to the temple which was fascinating. I asked dad about the difference between Buddhism and Daoism and learned that you can tell in temples based on if the Buddha is the main god or not. Some great knowledge!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We prayed at the front for a bit, well at least I tried, and then a‚Äôma wanted to get blessed by the people at the temple. However, the line was too long, so I said I wanted to leave. We took some pictures outside and then were off. Stopped at a family mart as dad went to line up for this mochi thing. I went into a random retail store. Couldn‚Äôt understand what they wanted from me so I asked if I could just look around. Went back to family mart and ate the mochi. It was okay. Red bean, coconut, and no filling.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After this, we went to see Taipei 101 <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. It was kinda cool looking. I wasn‚Äôt very impressed tbh. I‚Äôve kinda seen it before and in pictures. We ate at the bottom of the tower while a‚Äôma took a nap at Starbucks lol. We ate the roasted Michelin star chicken thing. It was honesty quite average. We also got boba which was good. It was milk green tea üòÅ. Next we went across the street so that I could the restroom at some mall. Very nice restroom Tbh. Then we went to Gold Menchi for the deep fried beef ball thing. It was honesty sooooo good. I tried to have a conversation with a‚Äôma about electronics but couldn‚Äôt figure out the right word in Chinese in order to do so. I honestly tried my best but sometimes the language barrier is too much.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After this we started to wonder around. Popped into a random brewery. Saw some live music. Walked by a random few restaurants. Then we found ourselves at a nice rooftop hotel bar. It was honestly too expensive and pricy, but dad wanted to go in. I tried saying no but to no avail. It was very nice just kinda pricey. We started drinking our drinks at the bar and then transitioned outside. Their snacks were dried seasoned pasta. Weird that lots of Asian countries do that.  After drinks, we checked out the strategy room. After this we went to a night market called Ximending. It was super vibrant and fun! We got boba at a place where there were two boba stands right next to one another. Super funny to see them compete. We opted for the more expensive one haha. We also got some good food. Some nice noodle soup. A‚Äôma didn‚Äôt come with us and rested instead. After this we went home. üòÅ

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up, used some WiFi to contact Michael J and Connor M about when and where to meet. Also checked flights and asked Davis to Venmo me. Went with dad to the pool. Saw a rock, sports climbing wall outside of the building. Traversed it for a bit before dad told me to get down. Went inside the sports center and looked around. I then went to go swim which was nice. Couldn‚Äôt really kick because my foot still hurts. I can walk but not swim. The pool was full if old people haha. Wasn‚Äôt busy at the start but got very busy later on. Got out of pool. Used hot tub, steam room and sauna.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went to go eat at a famous well known and popular pai gu fan place <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. The pai gu fan was okay. Not my favorite but still yummy. After eating this we drove to a random area with buildings and saw that there were soooo many apartment buildings around. Dad told me that most of them were quite empty. In this same district, we drove to a beautiful beach area. After this we drove back and got ready to go to the city. I also texted Connor and Michael to see when they wanted to meet up. Dad gave me one of Agong‚Äôs watches. It is a citizen automatic. Seems really nice and I would love to wear it around. Went to the city dressed up ready to meet my dad‚Äôs friend for dinner. The dinner didn‚Äôt happen. Decided to meet up with Connor and Michael instead. I went straight to their hotel.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Their hotel was the Via Lounge Hotel. Pretty nice with AC. It was nice to catch up with them. Talked to Connor about his corporate asset management job in 2020. Talked to Michael about art school and the pieces he plans on making. I told them about my job. The hours, said the salary was 97.5K and that I would be based in the us/sf. They seemed very impressed which is good, I guess. I am sure they will tell everyone how much I am going to make, and they will be super impressed by it. Talked to Kevin, Michael‚Äôs brother, about his college and how he made the switch from computer science to business. Michael was talking about taking Xanax for flight anxiety. Maybe I should recommend it to Davis...
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After this short convo, we went to go see dad in the family mart downstairs. Michael didn‚Äôt think that dad would recognize him. Dad and Connor has a good familiar son‚Äôs good friend interaction. Then dad left us to our own devices. We got in the metro, I lead the entire thing, and eventually found ourselves at Ximending <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. They were super overwhelmed/impressed. First thing I made sure to do was get a few pictures at the main entrance. They were okay photos and did the job. Next, we got boba at the place with two different same type of boba stands. Still super funny to walk by that place. Connor and Kevin decided to get a large cup each. After we walked past a fake t-shirt store that had a brand called Off-White.
											</p>

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Michael was super into the clothing and we spent a lot of time here. I helped him barter initially. Because we had brought up 3 times and they spoke English, it was hard to barter down. Still was able to get down a bit. Connor and Michael were impressed with my Chinese. The final price for all three and even just two of the items was not reasonable enough to Michael to buy so we left. As we left Michael wanted to try again. I tied super hard to get the price down. The employee wouldn‚Äôt budge. Said he would ask the boss, which I think he was, and would budge. No worries. We decided to leave again.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											It was at this point that we decided to go find food. It was actually super hard to find something good. Everything we pasted by was retail or not great/not Taiwanese food. Finally, we pasted by a random Chinese‚Äôs deli that had a line. I knew it would be good, so I got two pai gu fan <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. The guys loved it! They thought it was amazing. It was truly an amazing first meal. Put me back on top as a great food guide üòÅ. Next we walked around for a bit in search of more amazing food. I had them try the Chinese sausage in rice next. They loved that as well. When ordering, I made the order very complicated by asking for very different toppings for each sausage dog. The vender guy was a little jokingly frustrated about it haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Connor decided to get the sea snails in the vendor next to the Taiwanese sausage place. They didn‚Äôt like it too much and it was spicy. I didn‚Äôt like it much either. Lastly, we went to a stinky tofu place. Michael and Kevin were not fans, but Connor was! Connor had it before though. I also had Connor get a boba milk tea with me. Before this, Michael actually got a band aid for the back of his heal. It was pealing and bleeding. Not great. The ac in the store we decided to stop at as Michael but on a band aid was super nice though! After stinky tofu, we decided to go back to the clothing store.
											</p>

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Michael bought the shirt and Kevin bought the jacket. I was joking with the store employee telling him that it was funny to translate for the guys and that they had me do it. I also, asked him for his stinky tofu recommendation. He told me and we went. After that, we stopped for aiyu. It was very tasty, and the guys liked it. Last stop was in the Uniqlo. They looked at the t-shirts on the 4th ‚Äúspecial floor‚Äù. Michael and I went to the restroom. Was able to talk about Asian culture and stuff. Connor bought a random T-shirt from the ‚Äúspecial floor‚Äù. I let them go after we left Uniqlo and meet up with dad. We were planning on going home but stopped at the shilin night market. We got two beer and drank them as we walked around. Dad wanted me to do many things that I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on. The wanted to buy me a Nike shirt and play a ring toss game. I told him those were a waste haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I started to get tired, so we went to the metro and headed home. Omg we were sweating our balls off. I started to get a bit restless waiting for the metro. Omg it was hot haha. The first part of the leg was fine, but the second leg was closed when we showed up. We were then forced to take a taxi.  In the taxi, dad noticed it was getting very expensive. He started to complain to the guy in Taiwanese. I feel that this language is just very aggressive sounding. Anyhow, we got back and paid a little too much for the taxi. We got home and I immediately took cold shower which felt super nice.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											When I got back my room, I booked my flight for Denver. Goodness I mulled over the days in which to fly out for so long. I couldn‚Äôt decide! In the end, I wrote a pros and cons list and decided that flying out with Connor and spending two extra nights with mom was worth it. Also, the price actually dropped from $192 to $166 so it made a lot of sense at the end of the day. I went to sleep after group chat calling with Vincent and mom. Got to hear about V‚Äôs internship, which he seems to like. üòÅ

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up by dad. Put a new heated pad on my foot and he made me put on the watch. Not complaining since it is really nice haha. Called Agong to tell him I will see him tomorrow for lunch. Left with dad first to buy train tickets for tomorrow. They were around $200 usd total. Omg expensive, but I need to go see both agongs. We left and are on our way to the coastal part of Taiwan. Honestly, the drive was beautiful. The water is blue and it‚Äôs not raining atm. Our first stop was at the rice triangle bamboo leave thing place that is super popular and well known on the coast. Love the zongzi <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>! Mom was jealous for sure haha. We grabbed a few to go.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Next we hit up a random fish market. Dad said he liked the place. I took out my sunglasses for the first time since getting to Taiwan. Omg this was a mini fish market with a ton of cool fish! Almost everything was live, and it was cool just to stroll around üòÅ. I decided that I wanted to try and start learning Thai but gave up after downloading the app and seeing how to say ‚Äúcheck please‚Äù lol. We had live uni! Literally plucked out of their open tank and cut open in front of us. The dam thing was still moving!!! Very smooth and sweet. Def needed a bit of soy sauce to pair with it. Dad kept on talking to fish market people even though we knew we wouldn‚Äôt buy anything. Super funny how Taiwan works. We decided to leave and continue our journey.
											</p>
											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Mid way through our ride, dad started to tell me a story about the temple we were about to see. The temple is a dog temple. Apparently, the story goes... there once were many fishermen in a boat out at sea with their trustworthy and loyal dog. They hit a storm. In that storm, a huge wave formed and swept them all overboard. Unfortunately, the all died. However, the only living creature left on the boat was their loyal dog. The dog cried for many days before throwing itself into the water to drown with his master. This temple is supposed to celebrate the dog and his loyalty complex. It is supposed to remind people to always be loyal to those they should be loyal to. We turned the corner and saw the temple. There was a massive dog statue, towering over the temple itself <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. I got multiple pics with it, of it, next to it haha.
											</p>

												</div>
											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After we got our pictures, we went inside the temple. Dad prefaced the temple by saying that there is a rumor that people that come here to pay their respects become very successful. Honestly, after that I took it very seriously. We went inside and paid $100 NT worth of fake paper money and then used incents to pray at 5 different areas in the temple. The first was the outside area for the big god above. The second was the area for the 12 men that died. The third was the dog shrine. The fourth was an area for the fortune God. The last was the area for some bigger god. At all of these areas I asked for my mom, brother, and father to be happy and healthy. I asked for my mom not to have cancer (she had benign lumps at the time) and my brother to be successful and happy. I wished for my dad to be healthy and for his business ventures to workout.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											At the last god area, there were the two-moon shaped throw chance things. The thing with those is that you have the two half shaped moons. Two of the same means no and opposites mean yes. You can ask a question and it‚Äôll be answered in this way. You can try for yes as many times as you want but the less tries the better. I asked 3 things. The first was, Will I find a boyfriend? This took 3 attempts. I asked if I will be successful. It took me 2 attempts. I asked if mom will be alright. It took 1 try. Everything is good then hopefully! üòÅ Lastly, we burnt the fake money. I got a cool video of it. We had to fan the money out so that the oxygen could get to it. This was because the paper money was stacked tightly.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We left and headed to the main location, the geo National Park <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. We tried to find free parking but couldn‚Äôt. Instead, we parked at a $50 NT place. A‚Äôma met up with her friend and her friend got us in for free. I think we paid for her dinner in return. Anyways, we got to the park place and a‚Äôma and her friend decided to wait back since they had already seen it before. Dad and I took pictures, walked around, and sweated our guts out while walking around these amazing sandstone structures. I kept taking pictures of one landscape with the sun‚Äôs rays penetrating the clouds. Not sure if it really turned out.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We also saw so many sand crabs!!! They were everywhere! I was interested in hiking the tropical part of the island, but dad said we didn‚Äôt have time. After we had seen everything and taken tons of pictures, not with the queen though because there was a massive line, we headed to a seafood deli. Gonna be honestly, the seafood was amazing! We had so many dishes! Like almost 10+ for 4 people. There was squid sashimi, octopus, Salomon & yellowtail sashimi, snails, cooked fish, mangos, bamboo, clams, seaweed, some sushi rolls, and shrimp. So much yummy seafood <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. I tried to talk to the ai‚Äôyi but language barrier. I ate so much haha. We left and tried paying for parking at the wrong pay station lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we got into the car, we dropped ai‚Äôyi off and started driving towards the northern tip of Taiwan. We drove through keelung. Super old but pretty in its own way. Also got to see beautiful mountains. We are still here. Dad really wants to explore the city. I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to going home. We have been walking around. Found two different stalls. One was a mini Taiwanese sausage stall. The other was a mini tempura stall. We waited in both of the lines. Had an interesting interaction with a person behind me. We were talking about which line queued where. He heard dad speak to me in English and then the guy started speaking in English to me also. I spoke Chinese back with him. Just an interesting interaction.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got both food items. They were both okay. As we were walking away, we passed an old man that was coughing/laughing at the same time in a weird way. Everyone on the street thought it was weird as well haha. The streets are packed! Omg this is the busiest night market I‚Äôve been too. Very cool though. Dad even agreed. We stopped at a ba wan place which looked pretty good. It was a different kind. It has pork and shrimp. The outside skin was pretty good. We got up and started to walk towards the outskirts of the night market. We passed by a cheap electronics/phone accessories store. I stopped because I wanted to get a new screen protector. It‚Äôs very cheap here! Dad left to go get a‚Äôma. He‚Äôs been gone for almost 15mins now. Not sure what‚Äôs going on. They are prob just far away. No need to worry. üôÉ Can‚Äôt wait to start heading home and sitting in the car haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											He finally came back. Took him so long because he stopped at a watch store to try and fix the other watches. We bought a screen protector for me. I almost didn‚Äôt want to do it because I don‚Äôt know how much longer I‚Äôll use my 6s. Oh well. At least I have a new screen protector now üòÅ. We went to the watch store to get my new watch checked out. The guy said it has rusted a bit and need to be oiled and cleaned. We will do this near dad‚Äôs place. I will have to do it every 2-3 years to maintain the watch. After this short stop we stopped at 1 more watch store before getting to our car.  Dad only had to back up the car once! Then we started driving and stopped at another watch store. Idk why he keeps doing this? Maybe he wanted to compare the watch he already has?
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Going home. On the way home I was trying to teach myself Thai. I learned 5 new phrases. Hello, where is the restroom, I am from..., thanks you, and sorry. Home! I helped carry the ice chest and the guava.  Took a shower first. Tried resetting dad‚Äôs password but couldn‚Äôt find a way to do it. Dad keeps offering me food right before bed. I keep saying no. Talked about the Hong Kong protest of the law that China could extradite whoever since we saw it on TV.  Going to sleep! Thinking about crushes haha.

																	Even though I got super sick and felt like I was dead, it was one of the coolest experiences ever,
