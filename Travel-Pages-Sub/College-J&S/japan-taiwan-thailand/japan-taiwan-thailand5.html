											Woke up at 7:30am. Went downstairs and ate an English breakfast. It was not great. The owner was sleeping on the group of the lounge area lol. Left for the elephant nature park. Got into the van. None of the friends we made in Bangkok were on board yet. Picked them up on the way. So nice to reunite. Talked to some people in the van during the ride there. Met some of Millie‚Äôs new fiends. Davis slept because he was tired. Got to the farm and started to see elephants. I actually thought they were small at first, but I soon realized it‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt African elephants. To get to our final destination, we transfer to a 4x4 wheeler. All three of the ones we saw were female. We walked with them for over 3 hours. Fed them bananas and sugar cane.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got sooooo many pictures with the Elephants <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1, #2, & #3]</span>! They were so cute. They were domesticated gentle giants that had been rescued from elephant riding and circus üò•. One had her back leg broken and it could no longer be fixed. Another, had her tail cut off for tourist souvenirs. It was so sad that these elephants had to endure what they did. At least they are living a better life now. Couple random things: almost ran into a poisonous caterpillar but thankfully a guide brushed it out of the way. Saw elephants crush bamboo stems to get to the edible inside part. They have sensitive smell so wouldn‚Äôt take food that smelt like insect repellent/sunscreen. Eventually got to our final destination with the elephants. Walked a little ways to a mini hut area with tables to eat. It was a full vegetarian meal. There were dogs present and a lady there that had likely cooked the meal. The meal was fried rice, spring rolls, pai thai, fruits (very sweet and perfect) <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>.

											Funny story, a guy on the trip refused to eat because he said he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a vegetarian‚Äù. Omg almost everyone there just didn‚Äôt know how to respond lol. After the meal, we made medicine rice balls for the elephants. These balls consisted of fruits, rice, salt, etc. We also cut fruit and fed it to the elephants. They were just gobbling it all up. I got to fruit ninja a fruit! Omg I also cut it so well! Once the elephants were fed, we were able to bathe with them! I was the first one in the water and loved it <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #5]</span>! Got a good video of me splashing Davis right in the face with a bucket of water haha. As a group, we kept splashing other rafting groups coming down the river with water until there was one raft with an older lady that yelled at us. She was quite unreasonably mad and it was actually really funny haha. I mean, she was rafting and was expecting to stay dry? Hmmmm hahah. After we bathed the elephants, we said our goodbyes and got to rafting. Omg rafting was amazing! It was Davis‚Äôs first time! It was a 3 person raft so Millie joined us which was super fun <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #6]</span>. Got lots of videos. Truly tested the limits of how water proof my phone is lol.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											It was a short rafting experience back to where we started. We showered, ate fruit, changed, and headed back to Chiang Mai city center. On the way back I had an amazing conversation with a gal named Rachael from Canada. We talked about politics, finance, and a whole other list of things. Davis slept during this part. He thought he was starting to get sick so I let him rest. I kept mentioning to our van that our current hostel sucked! They all felt bad. We got some suggestions and decided to book brick house hostel since Garrett and Sam said they liked it. We got a smaller private 4 person room just to ball out a little haha. Got back to our first hostel. Packed up our things and went to the front desk. I decided to change my argument from we didn‚Äôt like our experience since we didn‚Äôt get AC to you told us we wouldn‚Äôt get AC so we booked another place that did. At first, the Thai wow hostel owner was quite stubborn about paying us back. In the end, we settled on half of what we paid for the second day. Wooooo! I‚Äôm glad we got something instead of nothing.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Took a grab car to the brick house hostel. As soon as we pulled up, we know it would be 100% better that Thai wow. There was a beautiful pool, better vibe, and fun decor. I was so happy we made the switch. We got our room and immediately noticed that Sam and Garrett might be in the same room. At first, Davis and I really wanted to have a separate room and were hoping that no one else would be in it, but it was actually good that we got put together because I became much closer with Sam. He seems like a really chill guy. We took showers and then Davis went to sleep while I went to go eat and drink a Chang with Garrett. Garrett and I chatted for a bit about general stuff, school, fraternity, major, interests, etc. Then Sam arrived and Garrett left to go nap. Sam and I really hit it off. We walked about being foodies, him wanting to be a nurse and not following in him family footsteps with firefighting, and how he and his Gf broke up. We even jokingly said we should go to Cuba together because we can (we both have passports from other countries).
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Sam was planning on meeting a chick from tinder so he left to go get ready. I went to check the clothes I washed. Mine were dry enough to put away. Davis‚Äôs were not so I threw them in the dryer again. Went up stairs and sam told me that his tinder date bailed on him. We then decided to go try food based on lonely planets recommendations. Davis came to yay! Went to the recommended place but it was closed. Instead, we went to an international food court live music place nearby. It was awesome! We got some Chang beers and a crab shack style mix of seafood in a sauce <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #6]</span>. It was honestly very tasty. We didn‚Äôt get potatoes and had to replace the clams with something else. After this, we walked through the streets with beers because you can in Thailand to meet up with our other friends. Along the way, we practiced our Thai and bargaining for elephant pants and asking how much they cost.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Eventually met up with our other new friends. Will and Karry were the two friends that Garrett and Sam had met the night before. There we also others but I didn‚Äôt connect with them as well. I made friends with Will and Karry easily because I jokingly went through the bargaining pitch with them. We all decided to go to Zoe Yellow, a bar/clubby vibe place. We took a red bus there for 20 a person. A red bus is basically a pick up truck with a tented structure in the back for people to sit in haha. Got to Zoe Yellow. The guy didn‚Äôt know how to count and kept thinking we underpaid him. Lol. He finally figured it out that we gave him the right amount. The club was bumping but was only alright. Kinda a weird touristy bar vibe. Davis couldn‚Äôt get into the main part because he wasn‚Äôt old enough. I didn‚Äôt like the mixed drink I got, I mean it was super cheap at around 80 Bhat. I was half jokingly trying to sell the rest of my drink and someone actually bought it. He was a tall black guy from the UK. Bought it for around 40 Bhat. His other friend was a white gal also from the UK. They both seemed chill from polar opposite sides of the UK. We talked about British politics for a bit before getting back to our own respective groups we came with. Davis and I headed out. It didn‚Äôt seem like Davis was having a blast since it‚Äôs not really his vibe and he is a bit sick.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Walked/jogged home lol. Got bit by mosquitoes a few times. Had a nice relaxing night. Got to bed around 1. Let Davis sleep and get better. Right before bed, we talked about our own insecurities. I mentioned mine being that I feel like it‚Äôs hard to connect with people the better I got to know them. Davis shared that he found it hard to talk to people. It was cool that we could have this conversation so freely. Davis is like a younger brother to me so it‚Äôs easy to talk with him. Hung rest of clothes to dry and went to sleep.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got up around 10amish! Super late and def the latest we‚Äôve woken up. I wanted Davis to sleep so that he would get better. Ate the free breakfast down at the lobby area. While waiting for breakfast, I booked us our van to Pai and motorbike rental for the day. It was only 200 baht each! Omg that‚Äôs soooo cheap lol. Nina, the planning gal at the hostel was so helpful and made everything very easy. We finished our breakfast, said bye to Sam and Garrett and then were on our way with the motorbikes. Sam tried rescheduling his flight so that they could go to Pai but wasn‚Äôt able to do so. We said we would stay in touch! One of the gals working at the hostel told us to be careful about the police. Apparently, they stop riders on one way roads and ask for their international drivers ID. Since we didn‚Äôt have an international drivers license we would either have to pay off the cops or not use the motorbikes. We opted to try and avoid the big street, get out of the city, and go check out the surrounding area.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After riding around aimlessly for about 20mis, we decided to head toward a mountain range in the distance to see what was up there. This was super spontaneous and not like me at all but when in Thailand‚Ä¶ The maps kept on telling us to use the highways but we decided that it wasn‚Äôt a good idea since it was our first day using the motorbikes. We opted to take local routes instead. We stopped at a 7-11 to get sunscreen because I was paranoid about getting burned again. I didn‚Äôt find a reasonable sunscreen and didn‚Äôt want to pay for another since Davis had one but just forgot it. We also got a sweet potatoes ice cream because Davis wanted me to try it. It wasn‚Äôt that bad! I actually really liked it. Maybe because it was a Mochi ice cream thing lol. We look local routes to get to the mountains. Navigating was a bit rough. I had to hold my phone, nav, and drive all with my right hand. I made it work by accelerating with 1 finger and holding my phone with the rest of them.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We eventually got to the base of the mountain followed the main two way road up. Driving on this road was amazing since there weren‚Äôt many cars and we could go as fast as we wanted to. Our first stop was at this random lookout/hiking point. We parked our motorbikes and realized we were low on drinking water. Not a great situation but we decided to continue on and just conserve water. Followed a trail that was a 5 min hike to a mini waterfall and water hole. It looked beautiful and very refreshing. We sat and meditated for a bit. A butterfly kept flying up to. I got a cool picture of the butterfly. Davis is scared of bugs so he didn‚Äôt want any part of that interaction lol. After hanging out for a bit more, we drove to another waterfall place but there was an entry cost to enter. Prob because it was also a camp group. Decided to continue up the mountain instead <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We then stopped at a random temple. It was very beautiful. I believe it was a Buddhist temple. Davis and I wore our shorts lower since they asked for visitors to cover their knees. We saw and approached a very peaceful lookout point. We sat there for a bit, did a random video blog, talked about how much Davis has loved the trip so far, and meditated for a bit. Afterwards, both of us rung the bell off to the side to send off our good wishes and vibes. We then walked around a bit more before deciding we should head back. As we were close to the bottom of the mountain. I saw another sign indicating a waterfall was nearby <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2]</span>. There was no fee so we decided to go look at it. The waterfall was not massive but boy was it cool to look at. When we first got to the falls, I noticed there were people near the top part bathing in the water. I automatically knew we were going to do it as well. Omg it was an amazing decision. I loved it! Super spontaneous and super refreshing. We went in our boxers. Had the guy on top take photos and videos for us under the falls <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3]</span>. We filled our lungs with air and let our an energetic yelp. It was the best tbh. So worth it. Then we finally headed back. Once back, we grab our stuff, took a shower and got ready for the transport to pick us up for Pai. I got fried rice while we are. Carrie gave us motion sickness pills since the ride up is supposedly super windy.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I talked with Nina the hostel lady. She was so nice and extremely helpful! So happy to have met her. She added me on insta and took a selfie with me. Got on the transport with Karry, Will, and their other friends. The red bus we hoped in took us to another location where a transport van was waiting for us. Currently in the van. I could tell Davis was extremely tired so I told him to use me as a pillow and that he never had to ask to lean on me. We stopped at a random place for a pit stop. I got Davis mangos because he loves them and esp the ones in Thailand. There was a beetle at this pit stop that was making a shit ton of loud noise. Got it on video üòÅ. It got rainy and dark for the last 30mins of the drive. I was a bit scared that we might crash or skid but we didn‚Äôt thankfully. Got to Pai! We were dropped off at the transportation office. Rented motorbikes for 100 Baht and picked out our helmets. I also booked our ticket for the van ride back. Since they apparently fill up quickly.

											</div>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Motorbiked to the hostel. Checked into our room. Loved the room so we extended for another night. The only bad part was that there were bugs everywhere and the bathroom was very humid. This was because there were vents to the outside in the bathroom. Left and got something to eat <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4]</span>. Before this, we asked the lady at the front for more water bottles. We walked up and down the night market. Saw one good place that had a ton of items for 40 baht. Decided to keep looking. Nothing else caught our eye so we went back. Talked it up with the locals at this stand. Learned how to say ‚Äúthis‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äù when ordering. I think because I was practicing my Thai, I confused them as to what I wanted to order. They charged me for only a curry with egg and fried rice but I also got another curry and pai Thai. I decided to pay them back since I felt bad. Couldn‚Äôt finish the pai thai so took it in a bag to go. Finished it on the walk back with Davis haha. We were betting whether I could eat it in one bite or not. Got back, showered, and hit the hay.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up around 11am. Got a message from Evan asking what we were up to for the day. We made plans to meet up himself, Will, and Carrie at the transport store. Met up with them and went to eat at a cafe called Sugar Cane. There were Thai and American breakfast options. I got a rice dish, Davis got avo shrimp, Evan got two dishes, Will got a rice dish, and Carrie got a burrito. Evan and I started to exchange Thai phrases that we have been learning. He suggested that I learn the Thai alphabet so that I can better sound out words. Hmm. I might. Davis was talking to Carrie and Will about music. Once we finished paying, Davis and I rode back to our place to drop off some stuff while Will, Carrie, and Evan figured out their own motorbike rentals <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>. Carrie opted to ride on the back of Evans bike.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											While they were figuring out bikes, Davis and I went to pump more gas. Will needed gas so we went to fill him up as well. From the gas station, Evan directed us using google maps voice direction to our first attraction, the white Buddha <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2]</span>. As we were arriving Will skidded on the gravel and almost got flipped on the bike lol. Carrie was told that she needed to buy a long silk tapestry to wrap herself in since her knees were showing. It was really cool! Gave us a wonderful view of Pai and the surrounding area <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3]</span>. I talked to Evan for a while about cameras and photography. He brought his camera that ‚Äúcrops‚Äù full frame pic making them appear further away. Davis was having a tough time with the stairs since he was sick. Hopefully he feels better later in the day. Next, we headed to see a waterfall. We had to bike through a rural part of Pai to get there. I got many amazing pictures/videos from this part. We arrived at the beginning of the trail, which also served as a mini campsite. Although the hike was long, we decided to see what we would find by just hiking the trail for a bit.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The first part of the trail was actually overrun by a river without a clear path across. There was no easy way to do it. We had to use unstable half submerged rocks to cross. The bank on the other side was muddy making it a challenge to jump to. Evan went first and made it successfully across. He then helped build out the half submerged rock bridge we were trying to use. Eventually we all crossed. After 5mins of hiking, I realized I had left my phone with the scooter. I ran back to get it since it was a brand new iphone 10SMAX and then ran back to the group. I am surprised I caught back up. While crossing the river to get back. I missed one of the rocks and got my shoes wet. Oh well lol. Caught up to them. We then decided the hike wasn‚Äôt worth it and turned back. We went to our next intended stop, the natural hot springs. It was 300 Baht a person to get in. I tried acting like I was Thai so that I would only have to pay 50 Baht but it didn‚Äôt work. I was kinda mad that we had to pay so much for natural hot springs. It‚Äôs mostly since I am way to frugal haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Anyways, we went in. Turns out the parking lot was literally 100 ft away. Omg‚Ä¶ We went to the hot springs. Walked all the way to the top to see the start of the hot springs. Then walked back down to enjoy the mineral baths <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4]</span>. Started at the cooler one first and worked our way up. The hot ones were too hot for me. We still all went just to try it though <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #5]</span>. Eventually we had enough fun and decided to leave. I got a chance to talk to Evan about meditation and self reflection. He told me about his 2 week experience at a monastery. Crazy to hear about his adventure. We then changed and decided to leave. They used my bug spray. The spray mechanism seemed to stop working. Oh well. Got back on our bikes and biked over a famous World War Two bridge landmark. Wasn‚Äôt that excited and we didn‚Äôt stay for long. Davis wasn‚Äôt feeling great and was getting sunburnt. Evan gave him his neck cover and I gave him my sunglasses.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We started biking to the Pai Grand Canyon. We got there! The entrance was full of other motorbikes and a couple restaurants. We stopped at one of the restaurant stalls and ordered some food. I got pai Thai and a rice dish. Davis got a smoothly. Evan got a rice dish and found 4 dead big fat flies in his food! Omg he didn‚Äôt really care, picked out the flies, and still ate his food anyways. This is when we realized that Millie had tried contacting us a couple hours earlier to meet up. We replied and had her meet us at the Grand Canyon with her other friends. We started our hike and were off. Stopped at the restroom first. Carrie paid for my entry of 5 baht into the restroom. Back to the hike‚Ä¶ The first part consisted of stairs so I helped Davis up by pushing him lol. The Grand Canyon was beautiful! The sky was so blue and surround area so bright. We took some amazing pictures/videos here <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #6 & #7]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I trekked on with Evan while the others just sat around. We talked about walking meditation being the act of walking and feeling all parts of your food touch the ground. Interesting... At the monastery they walk very slowly and felt all parts of their feet touch the ground. We went to the viewpoint that was supposedly the best in the Canyon but didn‚Äôt think it was that great so we decided to head back. Evan said he likes free climbing lol. Met back up with the others. They were talking about music, dogs, school, etc. I just hung out and attempted that watch the setting sun. However, there were massive rain clouds in the way. Millie, Ashley, and Forrest finally met up with us! It was getting dark at that point so I showed them pics of what it looked like earlier. Forrest was scared to come across since he is afraid of heights.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											It was then that we noticed a large sheet of rain moving in our direction <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #8]</span>. I mean, we could literally see the opaque mass moving towards us. We decided it would be best if we left so we rushed off. We got to our bikes and got ready. I took the rear with Millie and we were off. In the middle of our journey, the rain hit. It came down so hard. It was actually so dangerous to motorbike in those conditions. I couldn‚Äôt see because the rain obscured everything 20ft in front of us. The roads were prob slippery. Millie was going slow so I stuck with her and made sure that she got back alright. We eventually got past the rain and finished our motorbike session. I took a group photo once we got closer to town <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #9]</span>. Everyone was soaked but in high spirits! Davis was wet and super cold so we decided to turn around and get him changed. Davis didn‚Äôt feel like going out for the night so we decided that he should stay in and rest up. This was after we returned our motorbikes. After Davis decided to stay in for the night, I stopped at a pharmacy to find some medicine for Davis. I bought Davis some cold/fever medicine. It was the drowsy kind but I didn‚Äôt think it would affect him that much.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then I went to go meet up with the others. I found them at a random bar on the street. We decided not to drink there and got a beer at 7-11 instead. From here, we walked to another random bar. It was empty but provided a free shot of some random alc and had a glowing body paint station <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #10]</span>. Millie made me take a shot with her. I didn‚Äôt ask for any paint but got some rubbed onto me from Millie‚Äôs that was drying off. I then hopped over to the banana bar next door where Will and Carrie were there <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #11]</span>. Drank and talked with them and some of our new friends. Carrie and I were talking about me being gay and how it‚Äôs hard finding a relationship. Hopped back over to the other bar to get Millie. Brought her to where Will and Carrie were and bought her a drink for fun :). At first she paid me back but I gave the money back and said it was on me.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then Millie and I had a deeper conversation about how she has a lot of gay friends, her hookups, and who we thought was hot or not lol. I showed her Connor and she agreed 100%! üòÇ She said he was so her type. Some guy was hitting on Millie, I was making fun of her for it lol. We left and went exploring. Saw other bars but didn‚Äôt go in. In the end, we went back to banana bar. Evan bought me a drink. I was able to talk to Ashely about her travels and how she let go of everything in order to be out here exploring and traveling. She said she won‚Äôt go back home until 2021. I‚Äôm wishing her the best of luck. I couldn‚Äôt travel for that long... I talked to the other as well. We chatted about school and such. Nothing too exciting. Millie and I eventually decided we were tired and decided to go back to our respective hostels. Took a group photo before disbanding <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #12]</span>. Said our goodbyes.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I was still hungry so I stopped at a random food stall to get food. The people were super nice. Got my food and took it home. I ate it quietly so I wouldn‚Äôt wake up Davis, took a shower, and went to bed. At some point during the night, Davis went to the restroom. He started to overheat and tried to make his way out of the bathroom. He actually passed out and fell through the door. I immediately bolted up to go help him. He seemed out of breath and delirious. I gave him some water, propped some pillows behind him and let him recover for a second. He eventually was able to go to sleep after we moved him to his bed. I went to sleep as well.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We woke up and I checked on Davis. We had to get up early to take the van from Pai back to Chiang Mai to fly out to Krabi. I used the motion sickness pills on the van ride back. I gave Davis my neck pillow and let him lean against me. Also, let him lay flat and use my thigh as a pillow. I want him to get better soon. Wow I‚Äôm an amazing travel buddy lol. We stopped at the same pit stop when you went to Pai. Bought Davis mangos again because he needed to eat to get better. Back in the van. Davis was sleeping. Arrived in Chiangmai. Got a taxi to take us to brick house for 60 Bhat. Dropped off our stuff at brick house. Had Davis rest while I went to go exchange 300 dollars into Baht. Went to Super Rich which was about 5mins away. It was very nice and the rate was very fair.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went back to brick house and found Davis. Went to go eat at a northern Thai noodle place nearby <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>. It was a weaker curry broth then I expect but still really good. I also got a chicken rice dish which was soooooo bomb <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2]</span>. Went back to the hostel. Hung out for a bit and played some chess <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3]</span>. Nina had me write myself and Davis‚Äôs names on a cardboard puzzle piece for their memory wall. Maybe one day I will go back and see the same card. We left for the airport. Taxi only cost 100 Baht since it was a red bus. Got to the airport. Went very quickly though security. On the other side, I saw the Thai airline lounge and wish I had gotten the Chase sapphire reserve card and not the preferred. Oh well. Boarded our plane. I got seat 1A! Free upgrade! Davis at one point guessed my seat as a joke and said 1A! Omg that was funny and kinda unreal. I tried having Davis take my seat but he wouldn‚Äôt. Landed and waited for Davis to come through.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Took a taxi, 90 baht each to Krabi town. We had to switch cars 3 times before they took us. Once we got to the hotel, we checkin and went to our room. It was a shit room tbh. Davis though the beds were very hard. I wasn‚Äôt pleased so I spontaneously booked a better/nicer place in Ao Nang. I didn‚Äôt know that Ao Nang was the better place to be. We immediately checkout out and headed there. Got a random guy to take us for 300 Baht. Had to pay extra for the taxi but oh well. Got to the hotel named Centra and boy it was beautiful. The entrance was absolutely insane and the property looked to be a 5 star resort. I think Davis was very happy when we pulled up. It was my goal to make him super happy. :) Got our room. It was absolutely amazing. 4 star hotel for sure. Davis said the beds were the most comfortable we had so far. Super happy to hear that. The shower and bathroom were also amazing. We will sleep well tonight. I was hungry and knew Davis wasn‚Äôt feeling too well. I left him at the hotel and went to find some food to bring back for us. I found a pretty basic place. Seems like all the options around here are halal. Interesting. Stopped at once place and got two noodle dishes and an omelette. Brought it back. Davis was thankful but still not that hungry. We went to sleep happy and full.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got up late. Decided to let Davis sleep in. He seemed to be doing better. When I woke, I started noticing all my new mosquito bites. Omg there were so many lol. I must have gotten them while grabbing food the night before. We decided to save money and do our own laundry using soap and the shower. Really easy and only took 30-40 mins. Davis felt exhausted after wringing out a few clothes so he needed to rest. Decided to go down to the beach and figure out things on our own. Took the free hotel shuttle there and scheduled for one coming back. We got down to the beach and honestly didn‚Äôt really know what to do. Ao Nang beach was a bit underwhelming. Wasn‚Äôt really a beach to hangout at. We decided to go to Railay Beach instead. Only 400 Baht a person. We got in a long tail boat and were off. Omg it was beautiful <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>! The islands looked magnificent, the water was super blue, and the sea was calm enough.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we got to Railay Beach, we went to a drink stall and I got Davis a Thai iced tea since he never tried it before. He loved it!  Afterward, we decided to walk to the east side in search of rock climbing. At first, I didn‚Äôt think I was ready to rock climb but was curious and wanted to see the routes. On the way, we stopped for food. I got a green curry fried rice and it was much spicer than anticipated. After lunch we walked toward the east side of the island and kept seeing rock climbing booths <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2]</span>. I started to get the idea that maybe I could/would climb today. Davis encouraged me to do it which was enough to convince me. He‚Äôs an amazing friend and little bro.
											We found a cool mini shop on the way to East Railay. The guy seemed cool enough and I kinda liked his attitude. He agreed to take me for 1200 Baht. This turned out to be an amazing decision because I was the only one that was looking to climb so I basically got a private belayer to follow me around. Ahh this is so awesome!

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											He took me to an area called the black caves <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3]</span>. He told me he would lead all the routes and then set an anchor at the top for me to top rope on. Davis was amazing because he agreed to just wait and sit around while I had my fun. Once again, love him and am so thankful. The climbing guide‚Äôs name was ‚ÄúToo‚Äù not sure if that is correct spelling. We walked to the caves, which weren‚Äôt caves at all and started to climb. Omg he was a fast climber. I realized later that this was apparently his area and he was in-charge of insuring the safety of all routes. I mean, he owned the shop right next to the rock face <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4]</span>. Super cool to have met him. I did about 6 climbs total in 3 hrs. 3 intermediate and 3 beginner ones. I am glad we didn‚Äôt step up a notch because I already had a good time with the beginner ones. Davis took many pictures and videos of me. I would go hangout with him after every climb while I hydrated and rested. We started around 2pm. When 5pm came around we decided to end our session and head for the west side of Railay Beach. I wanted Davis to be able to do something he wanted to do as well.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We hung out in the water for a little. I brought my valuables with me since I didn‚Äôt trust leaving them on the beach. Got some real cool pictures <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #5]</span>. Eventually, we ended our Railay day and took a long tail boat back. The long tail boat didn‚Äôt drop us off at the same spot as we got picked up so we were all a bit confused when it passed the drop off spot. At first, we thought it would be inconvenient but soon realized that our van pick up spot was actually closer to the new drop off zone. We got to the pick up spot just in time! The guy was just about to pull away lol. Once we got back to the hotel, we dropped off some stuff in the room and headed for the pool. We got our complimentary drink and got in the pool for a bit. Davis was a bit cold so he didn‚Äôt get all the way in. I was feeling fine at the time and jumped in. Once we got out and went back to the room, I started to feel the symptoms of a fever coming on. I felt very fatigued and a bit cold. I took a super long hot shower.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After getting out, Davis showered. I rested for a bit while looking for a good massage place we could go to. I decided on a place called Massage Corner. It seemed absolutely amazing. They offered to pick us up from our hotel and drop us back off. We scheduled a massage for 9pm and got picked up at our lobby. The Thai massage was only 250 baht and was amazing! We got welcomed with a water and foot cleaning on the way in, a wonderful quiet indoor massage, and tea on the way out. When we got into the massage room, the lady was about to massage Davis and guy was about to massage me. I switch with Davis because I was okay with a softer massage. Apparently, I was right because Davis said the guy was much harder. We got taken back and then went out for food. We found an average place that was cheap. I got green curry, Tom yam, and rice, Davis got fried omelette and rice <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #6]</span>. Took some to go but overall wasn‚Äôt that happy with dinner. Got back and I asked about late checkout for 1pm. They put me on request. Went back, asked for toothbrush sets and more water lol. Went to sleep.

																	Even though I got super sick and felt like I was dead, it was one of the coolest experiences ever,
