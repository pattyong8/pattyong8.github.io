											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up around 11am. Went down with dad. He went for a jog. I went to Starbucks to figure out phone stuff. Dad’s notes were all linked to his yahoo account not his phone or iCloud. I will have to see if I can transfer them over. The WiFi issue was something I was trying to figure out for the longest time. I Googled the issue for an hr haha. I finally realized it was a privacy setting that I had on his phone. Had to turn it off manually using the passcode I set.  Just sitting in Starbucks waiting for the upload to complete. Lol dad nvm gave me his computer password. Went up and a’ma was ready for her interview. Told dad to go to his room while I interviewed her because I figured he wouldn’t be happy with some of the things she would say.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I asked a’ma one question. “Tell me about your childhood and what happened during it”. She kinda ignored the question and just talked about her life story which was almost all positive. I was planning on asking her more deep question after she finished. Mostly what she talked about was her life story up until today. So about my prediction that dad would not be happy about the interview, Omg, boy was I right. After a’ma had been talking for about 45mins. Dad came out. Told me to pause the video and started saying “let’s go” and started getting mad about something during the interview. He kept making it seem like he was mad because she kept rambling. He said that she never let me ask any questions.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I was mad that he interrupted so I took a’ma and we went somewhere else to continue the interview. We ending up going to the bottom floor of the apartment building and talked a bit. Most of the rest of the time was me expressing my frustration with dad to her. Telling her that dad is unreasonable. I asked a’ma one more question about her life lessons and we then ended. When we went back upstairs, dad locked himself in his room and wouldn’t answer the door when I knocked. I ate a zonzi with a’ma and then tried to talk to him again. Still no answer. I just hung around until he was done being a child lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											He eventually came out of his room. (Omg this sounds like a kid right?). And said we could leave. We left. As soon as we got into the car, his rant commenced. Omg he kept talking and talking about how a’ma is wrong, is self-centered, only talks about the positives, and never listens to him. The main idea of his long-winded rant was that a’ma’s personality type is one that only looks at the positives about herself, that she is self-centered, and doesn’t think about other people. A few funny things... 1. Dad kept saying that a’ma always repeats the same thing over and over again. Omg during his rant, he kept repeating himself over and over again (i.e. I am not trying to make you think a’ma is bad, that is not how an interview is supposed to go, this is always why I am mad at her). 2. He said I am a very patience person to listen to her ramble lol. I am doing the same thing with him rn haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											He also said, “I’m so sorry”. For a split second, I thought head going to apologize for interrupting the interview. Lol nawww. He said sorry for his mom saying a story and not doing an actual interview.  He is such a hypocrite. Everything he is saying (repeating too much, talking too much, doesn’t listen to what others are saying) is exactly what he is doing! Omg like I told him “let’s stop talking about this” by repeating the phrase 3 times and he completely ignored me and kept complaining about his mom. How does he expect me to treat him nicely if he can’t do the same to his mom? Ughhh. Anyways, we started to drive around. Went to the other side of the river. There were a ton of stone slabs with different types of rock.
											</p>

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then he decided that he wanted to drive to the top of the mountain nearby <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. We did that and got an amazing view of the city below. Honestly, all of this would have been more fun and much better if he hadn’t acted the way he did this morning. The top of the mountain was super cool. It was like a mini village up there. Way different vibe. More tropical and there seemed to be a ton of tourists and old people there haha. I saw many retirement homes. We pasted by some hot springs! It didn’t seem like anyone was bathing in any of them. It is probably too hot for that. Dad said that some of the places just channel the spring water into indoor tubs. I bet that makes more sense so that they can use AC. Tried looking for something good to eat but found nothing. Decided to go back down.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Tried to go to the goose place again but it was closed. Went to a hotpot place instead <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. The hotpot place was amazing!!! Broth was good but became amazing once we started putting meat in it. So flavorful haha. Dad kept on getting more meat because it was only $1 extra for another serving! Such a great deal. We’re thinking about going to a speakeasy and getting a drink as well as a massage. Ditched the idea after we realize it was already 6:30pm. Decided to drive around instead. I thought driving around might be better than walking so that we could go to another (better) area. Kept on going back and forth between the idea of speakeasy and massage. Finally decided to send it since it’s a Friday night 😁.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Heading home right now to get changed and do some research on the speakeasy <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. Here is a thought… Dad still treats me like a kid. He tells me to brush my teeth, do my hair, etc. I think it’s because he hadn’t been by my side since I was a kid. Also, he’s a bit controlling lol. Took a taxi to the MRT. Got on the MRT. Started planning for Thailand and I booked Chiangmai hostel for 2 days. Figured we may go to Pai. Got off and walked to the speakeasy bar called Ounce. Met the owner Chung. Super cool and easy to make conversation with. Worked in finance as a trader and knew his way around speakeasys. From NY. One of three co-founders. Met his dad.
											</p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went inside waited for a bit before being seated. Calvin helped us while we waited. Got seated at the bar! Ahhh so lucky. Leo was our bartender. Knew what he was doing. I got a mint and gin-based drink. Dad got the specialty milk, wine, rum, cinnamon drink. Left Ounce and went to a random stinky tofu place. It wasn’t crispy but def has the taste and stink. Then we went to the night market that Leo suggested that was nearby. Ehhh. Not that great and things were closing. We left and took a taxi to a roof top club near Taipei 101. I wanted to get more food though, so we went to Ichiran (the Japanese ramen place). Dad kept on complaining about the A/C saying that it wasn’t enough, and it was hot as shit. He wasn’t wrong... we left and went to the rooftop club.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											It was on the 48th floor. Had security, bag check, and everything. Totally not my vibe. Felt like a place that bankers went to wine and dine clients or for rich expats to take their partners. I told dad I wanted to leave, and we left without getting a drink. Took a taxi to the spa place. The spa place as on the 15th floor of a mall. The mall was closed and empty. The spa was relaxing but very different from what I thought it was going to be. There was a sauna, steam room, ice room and three baths (freezing, cold, and very hot). I didn’t find it that relaxing because none of the pools were the right temperature and the rooms weren’t any better. We took a shower before using any of these facilities. Also brushed our teeth, dried our hair, and showered off. All the guys there were old and wrinkly. Ewww.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After we were done with the initial stuff, we got dress in their robe things and went to the restaurant area. The hostess was very pushy about getting us a massage. Then a very pretty girl came over and asked if we wanted one. No, we didn’t! Ahhhh leave us alone. Went back to get our phones and then checked out the sleeping area. Lol it was like a mini, wide open, hostel. Went back to the original room. Dad watched The Godfather while I was on my phone talked to both Mickey and Quinn about possibly staying at bridges. Lol, Quinn hasn’t gone since I left. Talked to Davis about using my frequent flyer miles profile.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Talked to V and S. V is in DC visiting Erin for the 4th. Mom is doing her thing. Told them that dad wanted to take me to a KTV place with girl escorts. They told me to go for the experience. I said fuck no. V made a joke about a hooker sucking me off. I said fuck no again lol. Decided to go back for certain. Went back to put our phones away and then used the spa one more time. I used the sauna and showers and pooped. Final saw a half decent looking guy. Tattooed all over though so ewww lol. Left the place. Got in a taxi and headed home. Saw the city lights as we drove. Very pretty. Got home at around 3am. The taxi back costed 600NT. Gonna get some good sleep.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-top: 20px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Dad said we were leaving to go to a beach city. Talk to Davis about the frequent flyer thing. Changed his flight info to reflect my frequent flyer number and changed his seat to an aisle seat. Got into the car and immediately feel asleep. I knew we weren’t driving towards the ocean but didn’t know what to expect. We were listening to a weird English station that was celebrating international kiss day. Next thing you know, I wake up and we are in the mountains. And these weren’t just any mountains. They were a super tropical part of Taiwan. Like omg. It was beautiful! Everything was green, the water was a bright turquoise, and the sky was blue with a couple white cloud. It was an amazing time to visit! We stopped at a restaurant by the street. Dad got free range chicken and some venison. Honestly, the chicken was alright, and the venison was overcooked but dad seemed to like it so I didn’t complain.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We left and kept driving deeper into the mountains<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Got to see more and more of the beautiful river. Drove to a bridge as our first look out point. Omg was it beautiful. The water was a sharp turquoise. Got back in the car and drove to another look out point that displayed the Wulai waterfall. Once we were done with this spot, we went lower to the touristy street to be able to see the base of the waterfall. There we local native performers and everything! After this, we checked out a private spa place. Omg it was 800 NT per person. Yah right! We aren’t doing that! I decided that we could maybe go look for a public spa. We found one! It was at the river spa town. There was a large parking structure, information center, and tons of tourists!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We parked at the parking structure. I helped a’ma down the steep stairs. Decided to stop at the information center first. There was a mini feet public hot spring there! We all used it. I thought it was too hot so only was in it using one foot for about 30 seconds. I honestly felt like I was being boiled alive. Couldn’t stand it. A’ma and dad were able to handle it much better haha. I decided to get out first and look around for a bit. I was quite hot, so I went to go get an ice cream from the family mart. Ehhh it wasn’t great but only $1 USD. Went back to get dad and a’ma. Went to walk deeper into the river town and see how we could get to where people were using the hot springs. Eventually got to the end of the line. We saw all the people using the spa, but the entry was blocked! We didn’t know how to get through.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Dad went to go ask the lifeguards (I know, lol there were freaking lifeguards!). Before dad could come back with an answer, I saw some other people that knew what they were doing, walk up to the metal slate and just pull it back! It was mostly because an old man on a balcony above the metal gate told them about the secret door. Dad came back and said the lifeguard so there was no way in while also winking and pointing towards the secret sentence. That was sick! Walked to the gate, open the secret door, and were on the other side of the springs! Omg it was amazing. So many locals were bathing in the pools <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. It was such a cool sight. Dad and I went to the pools first. A’ma didn’t want to go. Wow it was piping hot! Dad almost tried to step in the super-hot pool that everyone else was avoiding. I told him not to because there was prob a reason why none of the other people were in it.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Honesty, all the pools were too hot for me except for the kiddy pool lol. I decided to go get a’ma and get her in because I knew she would like it. I brought her over and yes, she loved it. She thought the rocks were a bit rough… She wasn’t wrong. A’ma found a spot in the hot springs that was cool! Like actually cold! I used that spot lol. Took many video and pictures of the moment. It started to rain! A big portion of the people using the natural hot spring, including ourselves, left and sought our shelter. A’ma kept on saying that the locals said this place had chi and was better than the hotel and random other spas that only tapped the spring water. I think this was way better than paying $800 NT per person for a glorified hot tub lol. Walked back. On the way back, we saw a bridge being built. It’s prob for cars. I wonder if when I come back many years later if it’ll be done.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Dad stopped to get bamboo shoots, some sausages only serviced in the area, a mini bird, and what seemed to be massive slices of bacon. Omg these were all so good. I couldn’t figure out how to eat the small bird and got bones in my mouth. Not knowing what to do with them, I speed walked back to the information center and threw them away there. Also, used their restroom to wash my hands and drink their filter water. Dad went to go get the car first. A’ma got some apples from a nearby store and I shared the last of the sausages with her. Dad got the car and we were off. Started driving back. Only took around 20mins to get back to the city but we still had to drive home. Decided to stop at a beef noodle shop on the way home <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. Omg this place is Michelin recommended! There was a very long line for it. I kept complaining to dad that they were taking their customers in batches of 5 tables and not as a table became available. I kept saying it increased turn over time and thus less tables could be filled in a given night.
											</p>

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Dad pointed out that they might be doing it so that their line looked longer so that people would want to come and check it out. Not sure if this is the main reason but it kinda makes sense. I also thought about it some more and realized that they only had one narrow staircase to shuttle customers up and down. They prob did batches to free up the traffic on that staircase.  The beef noodles were amazing! I loved them so much. The beef was amazing, the noodles were fresh, and the tendons were huge! Dad didn’t get a bowl himself but shared with a’ma. Dad tried one of my tendons and didn’t like it. I added just a bit of the beef concentrated paste but decided I liked the base flavor more. I couldn’t finish so we took some home. We even got extra soup with it! 😁
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got back in the car in the random parking garage and started to head home. I tried helping direct dad home. While doing so, I realized how confusing Taiwan’s roads are. I took us on the wrong course twice. I’m pretty sure dad noticed but didn’t say anything. He seemed to be acting calm when I messed up. Very different of a reaction from if mom messed up in the past or his mom messed up now. On the way home. Can’t wait to shower my feet clean, pack, and rest up for tomorrow. I’m leaving for Thailand in 24hrs! 🥳🥳🥳 Stopped at the nearby night market to help buy dad a car iPhone holder thing for navigation. He went to go buy a drink from 7-11 again lol. Alcoholic for sure... Got home and started packing. Went to sleep. Had a hard time getting good rest. I had a dream about an adventure of some sort. As with most dreams, I don’t remember much haha. Dreams are really cool. They are like self-made movies. Wish I had more of them and could remember them haha.

											Woke up and started packing again. Got everything packed! Dad wanted to give me something. He gave me the Thai money I asked for and an additional amount of USD. OMG! It’s like I am getting paid to go on this trip haha. I told him no, but he insisted. He also gave me his money belt, head/neck pillow, and eye mask. Started to head over the airport. Was planning on having a semi relaxing day while waiting for my flight. On the way over, dad gave me some advice about being cooler and acting less like a kid so that people in the real world treat me like an adult. I actually half agreed with his advice and will make sure to think about this for when I start work. He also mentioned that I have to be careful about being too friendly and people taking advantage of me in the workplace. I also agree with this and will make sure to be wary of my surroundings. At not like I didn’t know about these things but it’s good to be reminded every now and then.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											However, on the way to the airport, I realized that my flight was a 12pmish, not 9pmish 😳. I stayed calm and told dad that this might be the case. He stayed relatively calm as well. We went to the airport to figure things out. We illegally parked and left a’ma in the car while me and dad tried to figure out the situation. We first went to scoot’s desk. They couldn’t do anything about it. No refund or help whatsoever. Next, we went to the information help desk. They tried to help us find a flight. We found a fight with Tigerair that was around $5,000 NT! Omg so expensive. They can do this though because I have no other choice. We went and bought the ticket after walking back and forth between the two desks for some time.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After we bought the ticket. We went to the checkin counter. Before that, I compressed my bag using a shoulder strap given to me by the luggage place and by taking out the metal back support thing. And did make it way smaller and I got through. After this, dad, a’ma and I went to the food court to grab a snack <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Dad also got me boba 😁. After the snack, dad wanted to buy me travel insurance. He did for about $100. Super nice of him to do so. Thought: I think he has been spending all this money because: 1) he loves me and I am his son, 2) he thinks I’ll get rich in the future and knows I’ll pay in back/giving me money now so that I will support him later, 3) has the means to do so even though he says he does not. After eating and buying insurance, they walked me to the boarding area and we said our goodbyes.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Overall, I really did enjoy my trip to Taiwan. I saw so much, experienced so many new things, and got to reconnect with my dad. I think I would give this leg of the trip B+. The only reason why I wouldn’t rate it higher is because dad was still dad for a good part of the trip. He is still an alcoholic, spends lots of money on food/unreasonable things, and yells at those closest to him/acts like a child. I came to Taiwan to 1) visit him, and 2) see if he truly changed. On the first count, it was a success. We went to many places, ate a ton of good food, and I got to practice my Chinese! On the second count though, I do not think he has changed enough to let him back into my life fully. Seeing him once a year is alright but for extended periods of time, it is hard to handle him. His behavior is the same and it’s hard to look past it after what he put my family through when we were all together. So overall good trip but he hasn’t changed enough.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Also, on the thought of him giving me a ton of money. Well his bet could have been that I would support him later because he is giving me money and gifts now. Although this may be true, I was prob gonna help him out in the future anyways. He is still my dad and we connected enough for me to want to help him a bit. I will never complete support him financially, but I would have given him a bit of aid, gifts/money. Got through security relatively easily. It was quite fast. To exit the country, there were automated fingerprint scanners which were pretty cool. Waited at my terminal for a while. The flight got delayed a second time. Poop 💩. Finally got on the plane. No problem with my carry on. Send my fam update texted and boarded the plane. While on the plane I couldn’t really sleep so I occupied myself with other things: changed by wallpaper on phone, played chess, filled out my arrival card (also talked in Chinese with of the flight attendants), attempted to nap.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Reflection while on plane: I think I realize where my frugal tendencies come from. At first, I thought it was just a product of my mom being money conscious and always stating that we had to save money. Instead, I think it that and a combination of my dad’s carefree spending habits. If my dad wants something, he will pay it without a second thought. He doesn’t try and survey the pricing landscape, he doesn’t look for alternatives, he doesn’t try and bargain too much, he’ll just buy it if he wants it (food, hotel, taxi, exp, etc.). I, on the other hand, am extra vigilant about getting the best price for my purchase; bang for my buck. I might be too frugal lol. Anyways yah that’s a thought.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											As we were approaching Bangkok, I noticed that there wasn’t a lot of light pollution in this city. Very cool to see. Landed in the DMK airport. Nice airport. Speed walked my way to the immigration line. I prob saved myself around 10mins. As soon as I got past I got a SIM card because it was only $10 for 15gbs of data. Got AIS because it had the best coverage and a 10-day plan. The exact number of days we’ll be here for. Once I got a SIM card, I took a taxi from the airport to my hostel. Waited at the que area for about 15mins before getting to the front. Went to the counter and a lady told the cab driver where to take me. The guy spoke pretty good English. Right on que, he asked me where I was from. I said Canada. He still opted to try and charge me an extra 50 Bhat. Maybe I’ll try another country instead of Canada next time lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											He had me pay tolls. Honestly, wasn’t a bad decision. Got me there pretty quickly. On the way, the driver was very lively, and I was able to get a language lesson from him. That alone was worth the extra 50 bhat fake charge. I was able to converse with him in English. As time went on, I told him I was from Taiwan, hoping he wouldn’t charge me extra. He still did cus I said I was from Canada lol. We started to converse in all three languages which was kinda cool. He kept telling me my Thai accent was good. I’m sure he was just saying that lol. Arrived near the destination. He let me off near it because he said it was too packed to drive into. I walked the rest of the way using google maps. It was cool since the walk was only 6mins. I thanked him for the ride and made my way to the hostel.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got to the hostel! It was in a random alley. There was a security guard that wasn’t paying any attention. Omg haha. Walked around the corner and saw the amazing pool and large crowd of people! Lots of hostel people were just milking around. I went straight to the checkin desk and prepaid for everything for me and Davis. We’ll be here for the next two nights. I went up to the shared room and meet two new friend Jigyasu and his travel mate. They are from India and had just done a trip in Vietnam and Cambodia. They were just doing a short layover in Bangkok. Meet another friend named Chai from Malaysia. When I was first meeting him, he had a cigarette in his mouth so I couldn’t hear his name very well. He was super cool and could speak mandarin. He just arrived as well. He headed out while the rest of us hung around.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then another guy came in. Forgot his name and it didn’t matter because he left right away. I hung out with my friends from Indian for a while. Decided to have Davis take a Grab from the airport. Put on a bugspray and went to go check out the market. Before going to the market, went to 7-11. Got two waters and dropped them back off at the room. Left for the nearby market. Super cool. Very vibrant and lots of tourists. Massages everywhere! I found a couple cool spots Davis and I could go to later. Stopped at a different 7-11, omg there are so many of them, and got Davis an ICE hehehe. Walked back to the hostel. Dropped off the ice on his bed. Went downstairs with headphones and my water to talk to mom. She was with Doug and heading to the community center to watch the World Cup.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I let them go. Watched random YouTube. Mostly league and the lead bouldering finals. Got to message Trevor about it since he was there. Also messaged Aiden for a bit. Davis finally landed and I help instruct him on downloading Grab and etc. He was a bit stressed. I tried to calm him down. He finally got in a car using my Grab, said I would see him in 45mins. 45 minutes passed by and I decided to go outside to see if he had arrived. He had an arrived and I was starting to get worried, but I knew that he would eventually get here. At around the 15-minute mark I decided to login to Grab and track his ride in real time. I saw that he was quite close and wanted to figure out where he was. I walked to where the car location was and found him. The driver was with him and didn’t look very happy. I soon figured out that Davis, without Wi-Fi, could contact me and therefore couldn’t ask me to help pay for his ride. I had to help talk to the driver and get him his payment. I think the total cost was somewhere around 400+ Thai baht. No worries though. All that mattered was that Davis had arrived. We got him checked in got his key and went up to the room. He got to his bed and saw the ICE <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>! LOL, I got a funny video of him drinking it. First day was complete. I told him to wake me up anytime the next day once he was walking out. I went to sleep and hoped that I get some rest.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up at a decent time this morning. Davis woke me up at around 8 o’clock. Once I was up, I quickly got dressed packed my day bag. We went to the second “social” floor at our hostel to map out what we wanted to do. After discussing for a bit, we decided to explore the Grand Palace and Wat Pho. We left the hostel and got our first full day in Thailand started. First, we headed over to the Grand Palace. We walked through the entrance gates that led into the temple’s entrance courtyard <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. It was absolutely gorgeous. I made sure to get some pictures :-). Thankfully it was not that crowded else it would have been hard to appreciate the spacing/placement of the temple grounds. I think it was because we went early in the morning. We went to the main ticket counter and bought our tickets. The tickets were relatively pricey at around 500 Thai bhat but it didn’t matter because this was just a part of the experience.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We went through the gates and started our first adventure. As soon as we walked in, I was immediately hit with a sense of awe while looking at the beautiful architecture within the temple grounds. We strolled around the temple taking in all the amazing sites, and of course, made a special stop to see the famous Jade Buddha. The main attraction at the temple grounds was a huge dome covered in mini golden squares. After reading about the dome, I realized that each golden square was meticulously hand-placed. Wow! We took many pictures. Davis commented on how my photo taken ability “wasn’t too bad”. Haha LOL my photos are amazing jkjk. Once we were done strolling around the main collection of temples, we decided to move on to the Royal Palace. It was absolutely gorgeous. However, we weren’t able to see much of it since a good portion of it was not open to the public. It was soooo humid and hot! Davis and I took advantage of the few air conditioned buildings in the palace <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>.
											</p>
											<div class="col-md-4" style="float:right">

											</div><!-- /.col -->
											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We left the Grand Palace and decided to continue our temple extravaganza at Wat Pho. On the way over, I started to get hungry and stopped at a random food joint. We ordered duck noodle soup and shrimp fried rice. Honestly, the duck noodle soup was pretty good, however the shrimp fried rice was a bit underwhelming. It didn’t matter since the entire meal was only four dollars <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. After our meal, we headed straight to Wat Pho. The entry cost  was 200 Thai baht per person. It came with a free water bottle which was nice since it was very hot out :-). As we walked in, we passed by a prayer section with incense and the half moon wooden pieces used to ask questions to higher powers. I showed Davis what to do with the half moon wooden pieces and the correct way to pray with incense. He appreciated the lesson saying he was becoming “cultured” haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After we finished, we walked around the temple. The most exciting part of Wat Pho was the reclining Buddha. This Buddha was freaking massive and looked to be the size of a whale. In the same building, we spent 20 Baht for a bowl of coins to drop in individual bowls. This was supposed to be for good luck. After exploring a bit more, we decided to try and find the massage school within this temple. We figured out that the massage school was all the way in the back of the temple. Once we arrived, we were informed it would be a 45 minute wait. We decided to wait at the location since there was air conditioning. Turns out the wait was only about 10 minutes. I told my masseuse that my shoulder was hurting. He gave me the luxury treatment. He really focused on my hurt shoulder and even put some icy hot substance to help soothe the pain. For only 320 Bhat a person, Davis and I thought this was 100% worth it.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We left the temple and decided to just stroll around for a bit. We went to see a monument near a freeway, visited a Starbucks near the canal where we saw a ton of dead fish oooooff, visit a random food stall where we ate noodles with bean sprouts and assortment of other toppings, and ventured into a workout park where we saw a massive dog sized lizard.  After all this, we decided that we were too tired to walk home. The fact that it was raining helped us make our decision. We took a tuk tuk after comparing the price on Grab. Saves ourselves around 32 Thai Baht. Once we got back, we decided to hit the pool. The pool was quite relaxing. We only spent about 30 minutes lounging around. I saw a couple of cute guys by the pool but didn’t get a chance to talk to them Davis and I decided to go back upstairs and take a shower. Exhausted from our trek around the city, we hung on the second floor to figure out what we wanted to do with our night. While we were hanging around, we decided to buy a day trip to the floating markets through our hostel. It was a nice and easy process. I kind of wanted to go to a speakeasy bar but decided that we could just see where the night went. We ran into our friend Millie that we met earlier in the day. We talked about our night plans and learned that she was going to explore another temple with some others she met during the day. In the end, Davis and I decided to go with her and her new friends to the Golden Mountain temple for sunset. Best decision of the trip since we kept these friends for the rest of the trip.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Davis and I went upstairs to change. We got into pants for the temple and in case we went to the speakeasy bar afterwards. We met our new friends downstairs and decided to head off. Our new friends were Sam and Garrett from California, Bram from the Netherlands, and Thao. We started walking to The Golden Mountain Temple for sunset. Had some great conversations with our new friends and learned a lot about them. Bram is from the Netherlands and is taking a one year gap in between finishing school and his job. He’ll be doing a small work thing in Australia soon. Sam is from a family of firefighters. Garrett’s is a friend of Sam’s and seems very cool.
											Millie was very cool as well. She’s from Virginia, is a vegan, and is quite socially and politically conscious. Before we got to the Golden mountain temple, Sam stopped at a Thailand fire station we passed by to see if you could get some firefighter gear for his family <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. Apparently, they collect gear from around the entire world. Super cool.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We were worried that the golden temple was going to be closed but thankfully it was open! We happily entered through the gates and walked up the stairs to the top. At the top we got a beautiful picture of the entire city <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #5]</span>. I taught my new friends how to use incense traditionally. They all seem to really enjoy it. We then tried to find a way to get to the roof. Eventually we found this entrance and was greeted by another golden dome. Since there were a lot of clouds it was hard to see the sunset. It didn’t matter though because we had a great company. We also got a fantastic picture on the roof <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #6]</span>. After this we decided to go eat at a pad Thai restaurant that the hostel front desk workers recommended to me. The person who recommended it to me was Ploi. She couldn’t come out with us though.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got to the restaurant and it was closed! We decided to go back to the hostel, reassess the situation, and drop off some of our stuff. The entire time walking back, I was freaking out about the sunburns I had gotten during the day. Turns out even though it was cloudy, the UV index was 11! I got Aloe on the way back to help with the burn. We met back down in the lobby five minutes later and went to Khao San road. Wow this road was lively. We went to a pretty popular looking Pad Thai restaurant <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>. I had chicken pad Thai and Davis had shrimp pad Thai. It was pretty average for pad Thai but was still quite happy because of the company. We also drank beers :-). It was here that Davis and I learned that our new friends were also going to Chiang Mai at the same time as us and had booked an elephant tour on July 10th. Because we like them, we decided to join them! It was around US$70 a person but we knew it would be well worth it. The day trip also included river rafting! I am confident this will be a great send.

											After this we decided to hit up a bar or somewhere to drink. On the way our group got distracted by the myriad of whippet stalls. Some of the group, not including me, wanted to partake in this activity. Because I find bargaining fun, I helped the group find a great deal of three balloons for 100 Thai Baht. It was funny because the first stand we arrived at tried selling balloons for 120 baht each. Next we hit up a cool looking bar with a lot of people. We had no idea what was in store for us <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #8]</span>. We started off by getting two buckets. Buckets are a well known item within the young tourist/backpacking world. Basically, bars will fill sand buckets with lots of hard alcohol and a mix of some sort. The buckets we got were strong but there was not a ton of it to start with. Once we finish these buckets we got a round of shots. While waiting for our shots, we saw some foreigners dancing on the stairs of the bar. This bar was very interesting because it was a tiered bar built into the side of a building. These foreigners got one of the employees to start dancing with them.... And then it happened... The DJ played a song, and the employee went off with a fully choreographed dance. He owned that stage. Please watch the full video for reference haha.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got two more buckets of Long Island iced tea afterwards <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #9]</span>. I also figured out that Davis had never done a blowjob shot. I am immediately ordered one for him and had him do it. He actually handled it pretty well. After we finished our drinks, we left our table and spent a couple hours on the tiered stair stage. Davis wasn’t having a super dancy night but it didn’t matter because it seem like he was still enjoying himself. At some point during the night, our new friends and I picked up Davis and carried him on our shoulders. We basically reenacted a bar mitzvah scene without a chair. Apparently this always happens to him. I wish I got it on video. Oh my God I had a ton of fun dancing. I told Millie that I was gay. As all girls do, she immediately became more comfortable around me. Eventually it hit 11 o’clock and I thought it was time to go since Davis was not dancing. I think we both enjoyed our night a lot. Got back to the hostel after getting a water at 7-Eleven and packed for the next day. Knowing that we would have an early morning wake up of 6:30 AM tomorrow morning, we decided to get some rest. I also needed to meet with Bram to get my $55 that he owes me. Went to sleep with muffled ears and a buzzing mind.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got up first this morning. Davis got up later. I went down to meet up with Bram. We exchanged a light greeting and he gave me the 55 Bhat that he owed me. We sat around for a bit before he left for his tour. Then Davis came down. Waited a little past 7am to be picked up by our guide. She arrived and took us to our van. Our guided group tour consisted of 11 people. It was very early in the morning so everyone slept on the van ride over. Eventually, we got to the floating markets. The guide had us form into a semi circle and then spouted some logistics and history about the market. Apparently, the floating markets open at 5am for locals when it is busiest. We then all got shuffled to the water boat paddle tour. It was only 150 Baht per person. The boat took us on the water all around the market. We were able to see tons of other boats selling products ranging from freshly fried chicken (yes, there was a large wok of boiling hot oil in a boat), coconut ice cream, and random touristy items.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Davis and I bought coconut ice cream because we thought it would be amazing! Tbh, it was out of this world <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Super creamy and icy at the same time. Next, we stopped at a stall selling leather wallets. The lady told me they were selling them for 1800 Baht. I was trying to practice my Thai so asked about the price. When I was told it was that expensive I said I didn’t want it. She asked me for my best price. I said 500 for fun thinking it was too low and that she wouldn’t accept it. She actually kept cutting the price until she finally got to 500. I was kinda surprised and really didn’t want the wallet so said no. I felt kinda bad but I really didn’t want it.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We kept going and saw some really amazing things. The water wasn’t as filthy as I thought it would be. Eventually the ride ended. Darn, it was so short! We had met some friends on our boat from our van but I don’t remember their names and they didn’t seem that interested in talking. Davis and I went to go find some food. Went to a place that sold traditional Thai food items such as pad Thai and fried rice. Davis got the crab fried rice and I got the pad see yew. They were both average. We were actually able to bargain for these items as well! The menus said they were around 200 baht each! We were able to bargain it down to 100 Baht each. Wow! After we ate, we started to walk around. Stopped at a 7-11 to look for a restroom. Didn’t find one. Went to a paid restroom. They were asking for 5 Bhat. I had 4 Bhat in coins and gave it to her and then just walked in. She tried to say something but didn’t pursue me over 1 Bhat.

											From here we were just aimlessly strolling around. We saw multiple snakes and other animals that you could take pictures with. However, we could tell they were drugged to stay calm. Decided it would not be ethical to do it. Tbh, even if it was free I wasn’t really that interested. We looked for souvenirs but didn’t find anything we really liked. Talked about giving gifts and how Davis and Marci don’t really do that. I also don’t really do it with my own family so I get it. Eventually met back at the meeting spot. Got in a long tail boat that took us to the village area <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. It was going quite fast at times and river water kept splashing on us. Eventually, the ride ended at a different point where our guide was waiting. Then we drove home. Slept/dozed off for a bit of it. Walked back to the hostel. Passed by a hat shop that had an explorer hat which I was looking to buy. It was too pricey though at around 250 Baht. Decided to look elsewhere. At first I regretted it but Davis helped me find another place. More on this later.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											As soon as we got back we look an hour long nap. Well, Davis took a nap and I just watched YouTube on my phone. After we woke up, we decided to grab something to eat. At first, we were going to a place listed on Lonely Planet. The place was completely empty, so I decided not to go in. I almost changed my mind and went back in, but Davis reminded me that I wouldn’t be sticking to my rule about eating at places where people are. I am glad we didn’t go there. Instead, we went to the royal family’s favorite diner. Omg this place was absolutely amazing. I got a pad see yew, green curry with fish balls, and a crab omelette. Omg the food was sooooo amazing! <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span> I literally ate almost all of it. Davis loved the crab omelette so I let him have it. I told him I’d cover the meal since he tagged along and wasn’t actually that hungry.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went back to the hostel to grab Davis’s ticket and ask about the face mask show. One of the hostel employees told us we should go, so we took his advice. As soon as we walked to the street, we were greeted by an unofficial taxi. He asked where we were going and I showed him our ticket. I told him we wanted to go here in Thai. He consulted his friend, called the theater, and said that it would cost 200 baht. Omg bullshit. I bargained it down to 80 by showing him the price of a grab car. The two of them laughed when I showed them that. Immediately they lowered the price. We took it at 80 baht and were off. The car has seat belts but nothing to click them into lol. Eventually we got to the theater. Omg it was closed literally only on the day we were interested in going! Omg omg omg. I wasn’t happy tbh since we had paid to taxi there. We at least asked to go in and got to see the theater. Then we decided to walk back to the hostel.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											On our way back, we walked past a variety of places looking for a big explorer hat. Davis kept on saying that this was all happening for a reason and tried to get me to stop stressing about missing out on the other hat deal. We almost passed by a shop selling army gear but Davis said he had a good feeling about the place so we went in. Omg he was right! They had a ton of the type of hats I was looking for. The ones that fully covered the neck and ears. I needed it to avoid getting burnt anymore! Bought one for 150 baht after negotiating down from 200 baht. Yay I was so happy! Got back to the hostel and decided to play a game of chess. That was actually really fun. I beat Davis and let him redo a couple of key mistakes. Afterwards we just hung around before having to leave for the airport.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											While we were hanging around, we started talking about me being gay. This started from him stating that Marci’s gay friend thought he was cute. I told him that one of my friends said the same. We kinda laughed about it. He said he didn’t think he was good looking and felt like most of his good friends are gay. I just told him that people like making friends with attractive people and shared with him the “you walked into a room full of random people theory, thing”. We then talked about the idea of masculinity/behavior/tendencies/etc. Also, talked about the difficulties of being gay. Then talked about potentially going to a gay bar while in Thailand lol. We’ll see if that actually happens.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Booked a taxi with the hostel for 400 baht total including tolls. Got in that taxi. I ran back because I forgot my towel. While in the car, I made sure to tell Davis that although I think he is cute, he is like my little brother and I wanted to reassure him that I wouldn’t do anything to ruin our friendship. I see him as my little brother and a great friend. I could never do anything to ruin that. Got to the airport. Got our boarding passes. Walked through security. Got French fries from McDonald’s to try lol. Unsalted of course so it would be fresh. The fries were good. Finished that and then waited for a bit. Filled up our water bottles and then lined up to board our flight. The airline had us take a bus to the plane. It was Davis’s first time doing that. I noted aloud that he was doing a lot of firsts on this trip.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got on the plane. Was able to switch seats with a person on the flight so Davis and I could sit together. Davis was sleeping. Let him sleep on my shoulder just didn’t know if it was that comfortable. Observation: the plane kept on having lights go on and off. Attendants also kept talking every 15 mins. It was def hard to sleep but ehhh. Landed in Chiangmai. Look a 150 baht ride to Thai wow. Was very disappointed in Thai wow. Facilities sucked and we didn’t get the air on room we booked. Instead, got thrown into a 4 person non air con room. I could tell David thought it was shit but there was nothing we could do at that moment. We quickly went to sleep decided we could figure it out tomorrow.

																<p>This was such a fun trip I'm glad you invited me and showed me an experience I won't ever forget.
																	Even though I got super sick and felt like I was dead, it was one of the coolest experiences ever,
																	traveling all over Thailand and a little bit of Japan. The elephant nature park was definitely a highlight,
																	I never realized how amazing they truly are and I definitely wanna play with them again. Thanks again for
																	everything and making it such a fun time!
