											Before embarking on my study abroad semester in China, I decided to visit Alex at Harvard and Tatum at Tulane.
											Because my study abroad semester didn't start until March, Alex and I were able to visit Tatum during Mardi Gras!
											It was actually perfect timing. It took me three year to finally go out and visit them but it didn't feel like we
											spent any time apart. We partied, explored, and made some new lifelong memories.

											The stars finally aligned! Since my study abroad semester did not start until March 2017, I had the rare opportunity
											 to visit Alex in Boston. He was taking a leave of absence at Harvard to build/co-found Luminopia. So proud of him!
											 Alex didn’t tell me beforehand that February in Boston resulted to one freezing to death in a thin
											 sweatshirt. This is all I had on when I first arrived. Didn’t think much of it while walking one block from the
											 airport to the metro. However, it wasn’t until halfway on the 7-block trek to Alex’s humble abode that I noticed
											 the frigid temperature. I had to hop into a shop to warm up and put on a thicker jacket. Thankfully my mom, made
											 sure I packed a pair of gloves else my hands might have frozen off.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I had to wait outside until Alex arrived back from work. Each passing second felt 3x as long as it should have been.
											Alex finally arrived allowing me to escape the elements. We hugged, caught up, and recovered from our individual long
											days. A suggestion was made by Alex to eat at Shake Shack. I honestly have never understood why people go crazy over
											this particular chain but gave into Alex’s excitement. We walked a couple blocks to the fast-causal location and
											ordered our food. The burger was not terrible but definitely expensive for what it was. I will say, however, that the
											fries were pretty bomb. Stuff and happy, we wandered back to Alex’s house and turned in for the night. After the first
											night, we got to explore a few areas. We walked around Harvard’s campus, explored HBS <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>,
											and walked around Charles River.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											There were a couple of other memorable events. First, I got to meet Alex’s girlfriend Catherine.
											Alex took my visit as an opportunity to introduce me to Catherine. I remember already loving her the second I met her.
											We got dinner at an Italian place called Giacomo's in the city of Boston. What a wonderful location with such amazing
											company. :) Second, I also got to catch up with one of Matt Brennan’s high school friend Sarah Zia <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>! We caught up over
											dinner near Harvard. Third, we got to attend a few Harvard social event which included a trivia activity and two dorm
											parties. The first party was for someone’s birthday. I didn’t actually get to meet them, but I indulged in a few Jell-O
											shots to celebrate lol. The second party was at the top level of one of the dorms. This one was a bit more vibrant in
											regard to lights and music. There were also amazing mixed drinks. I made friends with some random Australian girls and
											ended up hanging up with them for a while before heading back to Alex’s place.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											When planning our trip, Alex and I also decided to go visit Tatum in New Orleans at Tulane University for Mardi Gras.
											Since Alex had to still work on Thursday and Friday, I left Boston first to go see Tatum. When I landed, took an Uber
											to her place. Tatum’s house was pretty huge. After I put down my stuff, we went to dinner at a Thai restaurant nearby.
											It was the first time I had ever paid a corkage fee to bring in our own bottle of wine. The next morning, Tatum and
											I went on a run together. Boy, I am not a runner so it kinda sucked haha <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. After the run, I went with Tatum to Tulane,
											I decided to sit in on one of Tatum’s accounting classes for fun <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. I knew most of the material discussed since I had
											already taken multiple accounting classes at Cal. In between classes, we got lunch at a hotdog joint about a mile away
											from Tulane. They had unique meat such as bison, venison, alligator, etc. I chose an alligator hotdog since I had never
											had one before.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Later that night, we decided to attend my first Mardi Gras parade that had a specific theme to it… Purses! Before we got
												 to the parade, Tatum and I went to a nearby restaurant that served oysters for $2 a piece. They were soooo yummy. It
												 was a bit windy and started raining halfway through our meal. Because we were eating outside, out situation was not
												 ideal. Once we finished our meal, we decided to stick around for the parade. Since it was raining pretty hard, very
												 few people were actually out. Because of this, I was able to get soooo much parade swag! The parade goers out in the
												 rain were so welcoming and nice. One of them offered me her sign to take a picture with <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. :)

												The next day Alex arrived! He got here just in time because as soon as he landed, we headed to frat row and the
												Boot for some fun adventures. Tatum knew a number of AEPI brothers, so we did most of our partying there. It was
												actually pretty fun. The house was small, but it allowed for the backyard and inner area to feel packed <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. We then
												went to the Boot and get a few purple daiquiris, a Mardi Gras special. We danced, we drank, we partied. After
												hoping around a few other houses, we headed back to Tatum’s place and rested before going out to parades that night <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #5 & #6]</span>.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												One of the days, we also got to explore the more touristy parts of New Orleans. We walked past the Super Dome,
												explored the French Quarter, and got drinks from the oldest bar in the US (Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop). On our
												little sightseeing expedition, we made a special stop at Cafe Du Monde for some beignets. Mom was very jealous
												that I got to eat such fresh and popular beignets <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Overall, this was such a wonderful trip. I got to explore two new US cities with some of my best friends.
												In a way, I got a special lens into their individual new lives. I will cherish these memories and look
												forward to the next time we have a Mardi Gras esque trip.
