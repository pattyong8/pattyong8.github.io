											All of us at Virgo decided to go on a ski trip to Tahoe in early February. Although I did not know how to ski, I know this trip
											would be a good way for me to get closer with the Virgo house and attempt to ski. This was such an amazing trip full of skiing,
											luck gambling at the craps table, and outdoor climbing.

											Thankfully, this trip perfectly aligned with the week I had on the bench in-between my first and second project at Accenture.
											It allowed me to leave on for Tahoe on Thursday night and enjoy the entire weekend knowing that I had my next project lined up.
											Turns out our ride to Tahoe was in a huge white van lol. It reminded me of the vehicles we used during high school water polo
											international trips. Turns out the van was actually cheaper than the other smaller options. Having a van gave us tons of space
											to bring up ski gear, food, and our bags. On the ride up, we stopped at In-n-Out to grab something to eat. We half-jokingly
											suggested we all just go to Chili's and skip the Tahoe trip. Connor even suggested that we just turn back after getting In-n-Out
											joking that “it was the only reason why we rented the van and drove 1.5 hrs” lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we got closer to the base of the mountain, Matt suggested we stop at a gas station outside of the dense forest ahead of us.
											Thankfully, he knew that gas got much more expensive after that point. We also went to grab snacks and drinks for our trip. Funny
											story, while driving up the windy poorly lit road, Matt refused to turn on his high beam headlights because he thought it was
											rude to drive with them constantly on. The entire car tried to convince him that it was okay so long as he turned them off while
											passing others. He did not budge lol love that guy's persistence.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We finally arrived at Heavenly, Tahoe. The area was absolutely beautiful and full of lights. Turns out there were two casinos in
											the area. We passed the casinos and arrived at our hostel for the night <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #0]</span>. This hostel room was huge! It had 8 beds and two bathrooms.
											 It was perfect for our group and made for easy sleeping arrangements. Half of us wanted to go out to the casino and gamble for a bit.
											 It was super fun. We were all up a bit form craps when we left.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We woke up early to get ski rentals, figure out the lift pass, and pack out stuff away for the day. Lucas, Sahar, and Lucas’s
											friend were going to meet up with us at the Airbnb later that day. We got all our ski rental stuff and were off <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1 & #2]</span>! There was one main
											gondola that took us to the top of the mountain. From there, there we a number of other ski lifts and runs that would take you to
											other parts of the mountain <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. At first, we stuck together as a group and went down a few greens and blues. Eventually, the group, all
											of which were much better skiers than I, went to conquer some harder black diamond runs.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I was left to do my own thing. I tried going down some blue routes but kept on falling. I got to get better at skiing <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4 & #5]</span>. Maybe I will take
											a lesson in the future. Anyways, I eventually found myself at the bottom of another part of the mountain that had a cafeteria <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #6]</span>. Hungout
											there and recuperated for a bit. Luckily, the guys all had decided to make their way to this same spot! It was nice to sync up again.
											Turns out Big A was still out on the mountain on his own. Funny story, he has told all the guys that he was really good at snowboarding,
											as Big A always does lol, and turns out he wasn’t actually that great! He was better than me but that doesn’t say much haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The group all got food for the most part. I decided to skip lunch because the pricing on all the items was insanely expensive! Honestly,
											I wasn’t even hungry which was nice. Eventually, all the guys were finished eating and we split off again after I attempted to follow them
											down the blue run named 49ers. They all flew down it. Not going to lie, it took me 30mins to get down the run. I literally kept falling
											every time I got up. This was because there were bumps on this route. I decided to cut my losses with blue route and stuck to the green
											bunny slope for the rest of the afternoon <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #7 & #8]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											At some point the lifts were going to close soon and I was tired, so I headed to the bottom of the mountain. Dam it was nice to be out of
											those ski boots! On the gondola down, there were some real nice folks that saw I was alone and started chatting with me about life and my
											day <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #9]</span>. What a pure moment of human kindness. Once I got to the bottom, I walked over to the ski rental place but realized after returning
											my stuff that I did not have the key to the locker that had my shoes. I had to wait around for about 30mins for Varun and Big A arrive.
											Also, totally forgot to mention that we got a sick group photo at the top of the mountain. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #10]</span>

											Once we were all set to go, we went to the village and explored for a bit. I left the guys for a bit to grab a coffee from Starbucks.
											OMG the barista that served me was sooo hot. I chatted it up with him for a bit before leaving to find the others. They had found a place
											that had $4 happy hour Stardust IPA pints <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #11]</span>! This was such an amazing deal haha. We sat around a fireplace with a few other guys a few years
											older than us. One of them was a bit drunk and started rambling about how he’s a hardcore explorer in the skiing world. It was a very
											interesting and funny conversation. Funny Connor quote “We are Silicon Valley folk” LOLOL.

												After chatting and chilling by the fire, we left for the Airbnb. We got there before Lucas and Sahar. The first thing I did when I got
												there was claim a nice bed. It didn’t matter though because I gave it to Rishi and Olivia since it was the only Queen in the bunk room.
												After putting down my stuff, I grabbed a beer and went straight for the hot tub. Boy, the juxtaposition between the freezing Tahoe
												weather and soothing hot tub was memorable. Eventually, the other joined me and we got a full-on hot tub party going. I can’t remember
												if we just hung out that night or if we went to the casino. Either way, it was a good way to end the night. :)

											</div><!-- /.col -->


											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												We woke up to an amazing breakfast made by Lucas and Sahar. It was honestly such a feast! There was bacon, sausage, eggs, and shakshuka.
												SOOO YUMMY <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #12]</span>! :) It was the perfect way to start our day. I had decided the day before that it might actually be possible to go outdoor
												bouldering in the area! I got Rishi and Olivia onboard with the idea. We had a crew all set and ready to go. The rest of our squad
												partook in other activities and hiked neared our Airbnb <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #13 & #14]</span>. Olivia, Rishi, and I left to grab a crash pad from the main town and were on
												our way to a bouldering location called the pie shop boulders. It was the only good spot in south Tahoe.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Wow was it nice to be outdoors and near some sick rocks lol. We hiked up to the first boulder which was graded a V0 but it honestly seemed
												much harder lol. It wasn’t a great warmup tbh. Let me quickly add here that this was Rishi and Olivia’s first-time outdoor climbing. I
												wanted to make sure it was a fun time and enjoyable. After we attempted our 3rd boulder, Rishi’s wrist started to hurt which was not good.
												He took it easy while I climbed a few other problems <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #15]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												I climbed an unrated, quite easy, highball. After this, we reached one of the final boulders of the day. It was rated a V2 and had amazing
												flake features with a semi hard crux <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #16]</span>. Rishi seemed to love this boulder, gave it a shot, and actually sent it! Woooohooo! So much fun.
												We all basked in the sun for a bit before heading back to catch a basketball game Rishi was stoked on. We decided it wouldn’t make sense
												to climb the next day, so we returned the crash pad. $25 put to good use!

												We met up with the rest of the squad at the main town for pizza, beer, and to watch the basketball game. We ended up sitting outside so
												Rishi had to constantly run inside to see the score. The outside area was really cold, so the host/waiters brought us blankets to warm up with.
												How nice of them! Our table consisted of Olivia, Rishi, and Varun. Varun, Rishi, and I split three different pizzas. It was a great move since
												I was not too hungry but wanted to snack on something savory.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												After eating, we all headed back to the Airbnb for a bit before we hit the casinos. We got the entire crew to come with us to the casinos. I am
												pretty sure the casinos were Harry’s and Harvey’s. Only half of our group actually gambled. The other half we not interested and just strolled
												around/watched. Eventually, half of the crew decided to go home while me, Connor, Olivia, and Rishi decided to see and test our luck. Turns
												out it was the right move as the Asian guy with a unique rolling technique was on a hot streak at the craps table. Because of this, we were
												able to leave the casinos up! This was so much fun.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												We woke up the next morning, packed, and restored the house back to its original state. Matt drove for the most part of the way back but at some
												 point, switched with Connor for a bit of the ride. I tired sitting in the very back but got nauseous, so I had Big A switch with me again. I
												 passed out for a bit of the ride <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #17]</span>. There was a ton of traffic leaving the mountain. I mean it made sense since it was a Sunday.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Overall, this was such an amazing trip. Although, the skiing part was just okay without friends at the same level as me, it was still well worth
												the cost. I need to seriously consider getting a ski instructor/lesson the next time I go. I think it’ll pay dividends for double black diamond future PAT!
