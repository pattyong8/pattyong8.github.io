											This winter break was full of unexpected time off, new traditions, and wonderful people. I got a whole 18 days to work remote during the Holidays and I didn’t even have to use any of my PTO! :). We celebrated Christmas and Thanksgiving with Doug and his family. It took some getting used to but now they basically feel like family. I got to surprise mom and Vincent with their first big surprise Christmas gift ever! :) Read more for the details… New Year’s we spent with a small group but was a memorable occasion. I really got to bond more with Lucas, Sahar, and Connor. Cheers to more holiday breaks like this!

											I was able to go home for Thanksgiving. It was only for a short about of time, but it was nice be there are a 5-day period. During this break, we got to rock climb as a family. We even got mom to climb up the 25ft wall at the UCI gym <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>! This was so fun. Mom was a bit scared and having a hard time, but she kept pushing on to get to the top.

We made all the food and brought it over to celebrate with them. Mom, as she always does, did an excellent job cooking <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2 & #3]</span>. Goodness the food was soooo amazing! :) Mom brought a ton of desserts that were super yummy. There were tarts & chocolate strawberries
											<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4 & #5]</span>.
											Side note, Vincent and I got to throw the football around for a bit before dinner. We are getting better at throwing spirals! This was a new Thankgiving tradition!

											As we do every year, we decided to go to Mariners for our Christmas Eve celebration. Before this though, we decided to have Doug’s parents over for hotpot <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #6 & #7]</span>. I was surprised that they were actually okay with the meal. No major complaints and they actually ate a good amount! So, background on our Mariner’s tradition… Mom really like the music, lights, and message that they provide for this holiday. Honestly, Mariners basically puts on a mini concert. They sing holiday songs,
											tell christmas stories, and create a enviroment of joy tbh.

											This year we went with Doug, Coleman, and his family. As we did the year prior, Alex Wendland and his family came! So happy that this was becoming a tradition. We saved seats for them and our entire party was able to sit together  <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #8 & #9]</span>. To be very honest, this years’ service was not that great. They changed the set up to have the performers in the middle of the auditorium they had, also, we figured out that they only provide candled for the latest service. Oh well, hopefully next year is better and we will definitely make sure to go to a service with candles lol. Side note, I got presents this year! Doug got me real nice climbing pants and I got some other interesting gifts  <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #10]</span>. We got Doug an Echo dot!

											I still had to work on Christmas and Christmas Eve but it was worth it to be able to be home for 4 weeks total  <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #11]</span>! We also did our traditional movie hop day <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #12]</span>! It has been a tradition for awhile to go watch a movie at the theater on Christmas day and time it perfectly so that we could watch 3 other movies while there! This Christmas we watched Richard Jewell and Dark Waters. We decide to pass on the new Star Wars movie haha. The theater was actually under rennovation when we arrived so the main entrance was covered in wooden boards. This construction did allow us to get free soda
											since the machine was out of sight lol.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Sooooooo. I wanted to surprise my mom and brother with new iPhones for Christmas since they still had their iPhone 6Ss and the iPhone 11 just came out! They rightfully deserved an upgrade! :) Jack was gracious enough to purchase the iPhones using his Apple employee discount. Brought the cost down by 15% which really only covered the tax + a little more LOL but helped bring the total cost down a ton. We schemed a plan to have me surprise my mom and brother by bringing them to the Fashion Island Apple store and surprising them by picking it up in store. I put in the order and couldn’t wait to get home and surprise them!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											When the day came. I suggested we go to Fashion Island and take photos by the Christmas Tree <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #13]</span>. It wasn’t hard since mom wanted to go anyways. We got our photos by the tree and enjoyed the day at Fashion Island. We walked around, stopped at Lulu, Peloton, and even the Tesla store before finally arriving at the Apple store. I had us all walk in and check out the phones.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we got far enough into the store, I told mom and Vincent to go up to an employee and ask where to pick up orders. OMG mom and Vincent were so confused and then slowly realized what I asked them to do. Neither of them wanted to go ask someone and kept on saying, stop it, what did you get?!? I decided to drag out the surprise a little more and just said that I was getting a case for my phone. They didn’t fully buy it but kinda calmed down. This was until I went up to the lady at the pick-up table and she confirmed my order for two iPhone 11s.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Mom and Vincent legit started freaking out and continued to do so even when the iPhones arrived at the table and when we left the store. They kept on insisting that we return the new iPhones and that the 6s was fine and not broken. Obviously, I was not going to accept that and just told them that I loved them both very much and they 100% deserved this. We had been through a lot as a family and they truly meant/mean so much to me.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we got past the, “return this now” phase. We got into the “OMG NO WAY” phase hahah. Vincent legit repeated that phrase 100 times as we walked through Fashion Island back to the car. He kept playfully punching me and laughing. Mom was honestly shocked and stayed that way until we got to Auntie Anne’s then she also started freaking out in her own way. :) I had them stand next to each other and got a picture of them smiling holding up their new iPhones  <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #14]</span>. The surprise was a success!!!

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											So, I still had to work during this break, and since my SM and team were so understanding, flexible, and amazing people, I got to work from home instead of having to be in the office for the first part of cutover. It allowed me to go home for a whole 2 weeks through Christmas! I had to go back on the 29th of December, and I had to work the night shift during our cutover. Honestly, it was way better than working normal hours since there was no traffic and I was able to enjoy the day before having to leave for work. Also, I was able to order dinner for myself :). Love those consulting perks. Also, tbh the workload was lighter at night.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we finished cutover, I was able to go back home again for another 2 weeks! WOW. I did not expect to get around a month off during winter break. 4 weeks total! Side note, I had an amazing boss and team which allowed me to spend all this time at home. This was such a privilege coming straight out of college. We all shared the same room while working together  <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #15]</span>. Also, there was a ton of free food during cutover which was just an added bonus. :)

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I spent New Year’s Day and Eve working in the office at night, but it was alright since I still made it back in time to see the countdown and have a wonderful New Year’s Celebration with Lucas, Sahar, and Connor.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Basically, I finished work around 9pm and then Ubered straight from Viavi to Lucas and Sahar’s place in San Francisco. Connor met us there. We started the night by doing a short wine tasting <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #16]</span>. Sahar gave me a very strong gin and tonic instead lol. Once we had our fair share of drinks and watched the New Year’s countdown, we went out to a nearby wine bar to hangout and talk for the rest of the night.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											This place had only one other table occupied so we got the entire place, basically, to ourselves. Since Sahar and I were both the same person, we half hosted our own table. We kept grabbing some of the mini bites and bringing them to our table, pouring wine for Lucas and Connor, and chatted it up with owner/employees at this wine bar.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Sahar and Lucas had the wonderful idea of doing a self-reflection for New Years that consisted of something we learned about ourselves and something we wanted to work on for the New Year. I said that I wanted to work on being more emotionally connect with those around me. Sometimes I do come off as a bit overprepared and stiff. I wanted to loosen up and be naturally Pat. Some of this conversation started at the wine bar we were at but since Sahar and I were busy hosting and being our happy selves, we did not get a chance to dive deep into it.

											</div>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The next morning, we took pictures by the Christmas Tree in Union Square and went for hotpot as our post New Year’s celebration meal <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #17 & #18]</span>. I was surprised that everyone was down for it but also not surprised that I was the most excited once we actually got there. I was hungover and Sahar convinced me that drinking a beer would help make the hangover go away. I didn’t share on my self-reflection the previous night, so they all made me share after we were done with dinner. It was a great sharing session and we all cuddled in support :). Connor decided to Uber home
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Connor decided to Uber home. I stayed with Lucas and Sahar a bit, even though it made me late to work. We talked about enneagram personalities and they helped me better understand that I was a 3. Sahar and I had a bit of a bonding moment over it since, at that time, she also thought she was a 3. We watched a video on 3s that perfectly explained how I work, function, and think as a person  <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #19]</span>. I remember watching the YouTube video and breaking out into nervous laughter because of how true the description was. I will always love Lucas and Sahar for pushing me personally and helping me discover my personality.

											We went to karaoke with the fam, Doug, and Coleman <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #20]</span>. So fun! Mom had $100 to spend so we stayed for an hour and got a ton of snacks and beer. We sang, we danced, we partied. Everyone basically got to sing with each other. We did need to coax Coleman into singing but once we got into it, he couldn’t be stopped. The popcorn chicken wasn’t amazing, the beer was good, and the tune were on point.

											Vincent and I went golfing a few times <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #21]</span>! So much fun! I got my first Eagle on this course! It came off a terrible first shot, that I did in fact mulligan, but then my next hit landed straight on the green on a par 4. Then I putted it in for the Eagle. What a surprise. Now, this Eagle was not indicative of overall performance. I think I went 5 over on average. Vincent and I now have the goal of getting better.

											I got to reconnect Sam Klemek, one of the friends I made while backpacking through Thailand <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #22]</span>. He lived near Santa Cruz and drove up to meet with me at a mini golf course. I thought it would be fun to do something while catching up. We both sucked and the venue was honestly only alright. I paid for his mini golf fee, but it worked out because he had brought homemade tamales for me to try! :)

											We went to Taiko multiple times <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #23, #24, & #25]</span>! So Yummy :) This time, we went to a Taiwanese deli before to have Stinky tofu and green onion pancakes so that we wouldn’t be as hungry going into Taiko haha.

											On the last day before I went back home post-cutover, I hungout with Justin and Kate! Justin and I started the night going to the climbing gym. This was the first time I went to the San Jose Touchstone location. It was called the studio and was located in what used to be a movie theater. We parked in a pay per spot parking lot. It was $20! I was kinda freaking out since I am a frugal person. Turns out we could have parked for free at one of the lots. **Sigh**. We attempted some climbs for around an hr <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #26]</span>. Somewhere towards the end, my arm started to hurt so I stopped climbing. Interesting detail, I was using my super beat up mad rock shark 2.0s because I was planning on bringing the shoes home to get them resoled.

											After we left the climbing gym, we went to grab a bite and meet up with Kate. We went to a restaurant in SJ that Justin was apparently in love with. It was basically all you can eat Mongolian BBQ. TBH, it was so freaking amazing haha. It was also extremely affordable at around $16 a person. Kate met up with us! Ughhh I love her and it was so nice seeing her again. Unfortunately, I had to take a work all and take notes, because of this, I basically had to eat, hangout with Justin and Kate, and take notes. It was not a fun situation. I still had to take notes even after we left the restaurant and drove to a nearby dive bar <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #27 & #28]</span>. It took me around 5 mins after we got to the bar to end the call.

											Okay let me just say, this bar was divey as heck. Seriously, you could tell who the regulars were, and the vibe was interesting. Kate and Justin seemed to love it though, so I just went along with it. We got a couple of beers and just hungout at a table near the darts wall. We were about to play but the cost per person was unreasonable and it was electronic. We eventually transitioned to the bar. Kate kept on queuing up songs on the jukebox. Turns out each song costed $1 and she queued up around 20 of them… Woweee haha. OMG there was such a vibe at the bar and Kate queued up the freaking Harry Potter film score lololololol. I love her. Anyways, we eventually left and Justin dropped me off at the Megabus stop and I headed home.

											On my last day home during the first two weeks I was home, I met up with Matt Brennan for some beers at the anti-mall brewery area <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #29 & #30]</span>. We just caught up and chatted. Always so nice seeing Matt! :)
