											After living in Scott Street for a few months, our roommate Quinn invited us to go wine tasting in Napa Valley and have dinner at his house. Our entire crew visited two wineries organized and planned by a few of Quinn’s family friends. After visiting these wineries, we went to one of Quinn’s favorite burger joins in Napa for a quick snack. The highlight of the day was visiting Quinn’s home and having dinner with his family. Can’t wait to go on more wine tastings with this group.

											It was really nice of Quinn to invite our house to go wine tasting in Napa Valley and have a meal at his house afterward. The two wineries we visited were amazing. The first winery we visited was in a private room and the owner of the winery actually led us through our tasting. Each of the wines had an intricate taste and were quite amazing. The owner was very personable and told us a lot about wine making within his own winery. Ryan and Gus started asking him bio questions.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The second wine tasting venue was all outdoors. We got to enjoy our wine on the rooftop of the main lobby area. It was so nice and sunny, perfect conditions for wine tasting. One of the wines we had was the Trilogy. I thought it was quite dry but did learn to appreciate it as the night went on. It was at this winery that we really got to start talking to Quinn’s family friends. They were Irish and extremely funny. The slimmer one loved shit talking, Gus made sure to give him lots of shit as well haha. Very fun dynamic.

											After wine tasting, we went back to Quinn’s house, played some beer die, and ate dinner outside with his family. OMG that was so much fun! Quinn grilled some chicken and burnt some of it lol. The rice was amazing and I had so much food. His parents were really nice. Apparently, his dad was ex-Google. Sister currently going to Berkeley.
