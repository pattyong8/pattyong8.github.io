											This trip was the second week of training at Accenture’s NA training headquarters. We were able to interact with new analyst from all over NA and learn more about how Accenture functions as a company. It was an amazing opportunity to get closer with my start class, grow my understanding of the consulting world, and perform at my best. I will cherish the memories and friendships I gained from this training. In my opinion, Accenture’s orientation + new joiner training is very effective. This training also gave me an opportunity to visit Nate in Chicago. It was so nice to catch up with him and see how his life is going in this new city.

											This was the start of my second week at Accenture! The first week was great, my start class is amazing, social, and everyone vibes well with each other. However, it was so exciting being able to travel for the first time as a consultant! Our second week of training was located at St. Charles in Chicago, which is Accenture’s very own corporate training center. I decided I would make the most sense to leave for St. Charles on Sunday so I could still get the entire weekend in the bay area.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Left for St. Charles in the morning. Everything was paid for which was quite nice :). Got on my direct flight to Chicago and was off! OMG when I arrived, I was picked up in a freaking full stretch limo <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1 & #2]</span>. So fancy :). I shared the limo with a few other analysts from the Atlanta office. The drive was around 30mins. I thought about taking a nap in the limo but that just didn’t make that much sense.

											We eventually arrived at the beautiful campus of St. Charles <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. It was basically built on a golf course out in the middle of a suburban area. When I arrived, I ran into Bella, Joy, and Harrison. I was on the same floor as Bella so we went to our rooms together. Not going to lie, the rooms in this place were tiny! Like the size of a cruise ship room. Honestly, it did the job. I went to go eat dinner on my own since I felt like having a semi relaxing night.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Dinner was surprisingly great! There were so many amazing options and I was STARVING :). I was FTing mom and just catching but saw that John, one of our Accenture trainers was coming my way, I quickly said bye to mom and joined John and another one of his friends for dinner. Turns out John friend was one of the planners for this entire training. Very impressive. I finished my dinner and eventually took my leave. I hungout in my room for a bit before forcing myself to go lift at the gym <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. No one was really there so I had the place to myself. I just remember being too full to go all out on lifting haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											On my way back from the gym, I passed a topgolf trip flyer that caught my eye <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #5]</span>!. I decided to convince a good number of my start class to come! I went back up to my room, FTed mom again and then went to sleep.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I got up early and got ready for my first day of St. Charles training <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #6]</span>! I met up with Bella and we made our way to the main ballroom area. We grabbed a few pastries and coffee and found a space for our class to sit and hangout. The first part of the training was all pretty basic stuff<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>. We went over the week’s agenda, Accenture principals, and heard from a panel of analysts. We eventually broke up into groups and all of us headed out on our own. My first group was with John, our very own NorCal training teacher, and another manager named Jackie. My training group included Shamsya, Aileen, Nivi, and Briar. Not gonna lie, our team was an absolute powerhouse :). Also, our teachers, especially Jackie, were amazing! So informative and had a high set of standards that I resonated with.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The training at St. Charles included our premade teams creating an example client by selecting things such as industry, product, and background. Throughout the week, we would be given a number of prompts and had to present on a solution or task. It was basically a mock case competition lol. What I noticed was that some teams took this activity more seriously than others. My team was full of try hards so we dominated :).
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After a long and tiring first day, our entire start class from NorCal decided we needed a drink. We basically took over the mini bar at the Q Center lol <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #8]</span>. This set a precedent for the rest of the week. Word started to spread that the Q pub was going to be open that night. Apparently, it was just some full-on bar that people on the training grounds could party at. Our entire group decided we would attend after dinner. Some of us went back to our rooms to freshen up and then our entire class went down to the Cafeteria to eat.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We all hungout for a bit before heading to the Q pub. It was right on the campus and actually was a pretty large space! There was a full 360-degree bar, a karaoke area, and tons of people. We had learned during our NorCal training that Justin loves T-Swift so we made him karaoke it in front of everyone else at the bar <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #9]</span>! Since the song was Wildest Dreams, I obvi had to join in! What a song full of interesting memories. After leaving the bar, we all went back to our rooms and got ready for the next day of training.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The day started with an early, full conference meeting where all participants played a massive rock, paper, scissors tournament. Our very own Michael Van Hoesen made it to the semifinals and got to play the final rounds on stage <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #10]</span>! Because we were cheering for so loudly for Michael, we caught the moderator’s attention and he specifically called out the SF office as being energetic and rowdy. Love it hahahaha. Michael unfortunately lost but it didn’t matter because it was awesome just seeing him kill it on stage :).
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We then broke back into our groups and continued our day full of activities with consultant themed challenges. We got to decorate our boxes and fully built out the client today. We chose the name “Healthy Nerds” which was a healthcare company trying to revolutionize the way their clients interacted with their doctors <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #11]</span>. During one of the breaks, I drew SpongeBob SquarePants under the prompt “Favorite Celebrities” lol <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #12]</span>.

											Eventually the day ended, and it was topgolf time! I gathered those in my class that had signed up to go and we all went to the bus that was taking us to the topgolf location. We actually almost missed the bus! Also, Harrison and Reena unfortunately forgot their ticket somewhere and had to go back to find it. Because of this, the bus left, and they had to Uber to the top golf location. We had Justin, Ian, Jacqueline, Harrison, Traci, and Reena! Ahhh it was so much fun :) <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #13]</span>. Once we got back, we met up with the rest of our start class that all decided to hangout by a fire. We all got a wholesome picture of the night <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #14]</span>.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											A couple things happened today. During our NorCal training, one of my fellow analysts came out to me and another analyst that they were LGBTQ+ and I accidentally outed them when with another group of analysts in our start class. I was disappointed in myself and apologized. It brought up an interesting conversation amongst us, but my action was still inappropriate. Second thing that happened was that Justin, Renna, and I all had a heartfelt conversation about our families, relationships, and backstory after everyone else had left the campfire area. We all cried with each other and had a memorable moment. They turned out to be two of my best friends in my start class :).

											The day started with a curveball! We were told that we were getting put into completely different teams in different rooms! :(. This was supposed to mimic the dynamic nature of consulting. Because I already had an amazing team and instructors, I was less than willing to leave my group. I left my room and joined a new one with two subpar instructors. The good part was that my team was just as amazing, and we continued to win 1st place in all the group presentation competitions <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #15]</span>.

											Tonight, was the networking banquet esq night <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #17]</span>. Our entire group kept on joking about how clickily of a start class we were. We were really only hanging out with each other and didn’t really network outside of our office too much. Honestly, I didn’t mind it since we would probably see each other the most anyways. I got to know Catherine better tonight. We had a pretty heart to heart conversation about significant others, dating, and love life. Catherine is amazing, love her. We had Jackie and John join us for dinner and we all got a nice group photo during the happy hour portion <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #18]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											At some point I went up to Jackie to talk to her about my experience so far and how much I have liked it. I thought it was important to do since she was a very capable leader and seemed to have her life figured out haha. She said that I was her favorite from the entire training referencing my executive presence as a determining factor. Overall it was a confidence boost of sorts. Eventually the banquet came to a close. We decided to have a room party in Desmond’s! It was actually such a time and John even came by for a bit of it <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #19]</span>!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											This party slowly transitioned into all of us going to hanging out at the mini bar area. It was actually a very interesting time because the main organizer of the event, James Sculley, was hammered and hanging out with all the analysts haha. I got around to talking to him and he referred me to Bennett for PRIDE at NorCal Accenture. Oh totally funny moment, I was audacious enough to go behind the bar and started to pour water for everyone at the bar to hydrate everyone. This was because the bar was closed and there wasn’t a bartender. OMG about 2 mins after I was behind the bar, a security guard came and freaked out haha. Jackie, my instructor, kinda came out of nowhere and saved me from the situation. It was around 1am when I eventually went back to my room.

Because of this, we were given the opportunity to speak in front of everyone and share our client box <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #20]</span>. Ahhh this was so cool! I made sure to get a picture with both of my teams as we all kicked ass this week<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #21 & #22]</span>! :) This was the last activity on our agenda, so all conference participants took their leave. My plan was to go visit Nate in Chicago. I found a few others in my start class that were also planning on going into the city. We all split an Uber and headed to Chicago. Funny note, while in the Uber, we were checking our snapchat group for accolades and apparently Justin was deemed “paparazzi” because he took the most screenshots lol <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #23]</span>. We def exposed him haha.

											Once I got to Chicago, I waited at a Starbucks near Nate’s apartment for him to finish work <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #24]</span>. I basically just hungout and did some random work. Eventually, Nate arrived! Ahhh it was so nice to see him again. It had been too long. We walked to his apartment and had a beer <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #25]</span>. His apartment was very nice and actually use to a preschool. We caught up for a bit. I got to hear all about Nate’s new job and how much he likes it. So happy for him! :) Had dinner on the roof of Nate with Nathan’s place <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #26]</span>. It was a wonderful salmon and salad dinner. After this, Nate and I went to the Goose Island brewery to continue out catch up conversation and drink some nice beers. I got a glass from here! After this, we went back to Nate’s place and got ready to head to the Bay Area the next day.

											We got up very early and Ubered to the airport. Got some food and waited to board our flight <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #27]</span>. We were both pretty tired and attempted to nap for a bit. I completely passed during our flight. Landed and took bart to the Virgo. Got a funny picture on the way <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #28]</span> :).

											Overall this trip was amazing. It gave my start class the time and space it needed to grow close with one another. I am so thankful for the friendships and connections I made during this week. Accenture’s training facility was actually kinda bomb. I am so lucky to be working at a company with these types of resources. Can’t wait to come back and make new friends. I am also so glad that this gave me an opportunity to visit Nate in his new life in Chicago. It is always so nice to hangout with him.
