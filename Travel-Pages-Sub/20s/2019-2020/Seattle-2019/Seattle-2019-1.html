											Eric and I decided to go visit our friends in Seattle for a weekend. It had been almost 2 years since we all hungout
											as a group but it felt like no time had passed. This crew is truly a friend group I hold close to my heart and feel
											extremely comfortable around. We hit up Fremont Brewery, saw Cash Cash, and climbed at SBP during the Northwest BoulderFest!
										  So much fun and a trip to remember.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											About 2 months before Nov 16th, Eric and I decided we really want to go see our friends in Seattle and have a reunion of sorts. While working for my first client at Accenture, I was able to work Friday’s remote. Because of this, I left for Seattle early on Friday morning and worked from the Seattle Accenture innovation hub office. This office location was absolutely beautiful <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. I talked to Catherine, my Accenture friend, about the Seattle office. I made friends with the front desk lady and got to see Tavish, another Accenture friend I met at St. Charles. Funny memory, there was a Starbucks coffee making machine that I faced timed mom about and bragged about. She was so jealous.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I had Eric meet me at the Accenture office since he also landed sometime that morning and had nothing else to do. Unfortunately, I actually had work to do that day, so I was busy for a large part of the day. Eric was lucky and didn’t have much to do. We were able to stop around lunch time and grab food. I had Eric decide where we were going. He picked a stir-fry place nearby that actually wasn’t half bad! Since I was busy, I had us take the food back and eat at the office.
											While eating, Eric and I were able to catch up for a bit before I needed to go back to work.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I felt bad that I was so busy because Eric didn’t have much to do and I didn’t want him to wait around for me to finish. He did though cus he’s such a great friend :). Eventually, I was able to finish up for the day. We headed to Danny’s place to drop off our stuff. He left his door open and buzzed us in through the apartment front door. Wow his place was nice. It was a single bedroom apartment with a massive living space, bedroom, and stellar balcony. There were a number of beautiful photos displayed throughout his apartment. I later found out that he took most of them.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After we dropped our stuff off, we went straight for Fremont brewery company, our home base in Seattle. This is a location that our Seattle crew went to all the time and where some of our best memories were formed. Eric and I got there first, grabbed our beers, and waited for everyone else to come. Mimi was the first to arrive <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2 & #3]</span>. I missed her! :) Then Noah showed up followed by Ross, Jack, and Danny <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4, #5, #6, #7, & #8]</span>. It was so nice to see everyone again. We transitioned from the main Fremont Brewery area to a separate tasting room they had in the back of their building, Black Heron Lounge.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											They didn’t allow beverages from the main area in, so I had to improvise when bringing my beer in. The separate area was called the black heron and featured lighter beers. I loved their glass so I got one to add to my collection! We eventually left this area and went to get food. The group decided on a place within walking distance from the Black Heron Lounge. OMG this place served fired chicken and waffles and it was AMAZING! OMG wow, like wow. The only bad part about this dish was that they only had one waffle maker they could only make it one dish at a time and our entire group of 7+ ordered it lol. Jeff and his girlfriend met up with us here! :)
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we were done with dinner, we decided to head to Jack’s apartment which was only a few blocks away. Jack’s place had a really sick roof and was a great size to accommodate our entire group. Once we were ready to move on, we headed to Danny’s place to regroup and get ready to go out.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											OMG… Anyone reading this would never guess what happened next… On the elevator ride down from Danny’s place <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #9]</span>, Danny suggested we all jump at the same time to get the elevator to jolt a bit. We did as he suggested… 1, 2, 3, JUMP. The elevator came to a sudden halt. WE WERE STUCK. WE GOT OURSELVES SUCK IN AN ELEVATOR. For the first time in my life, I had to push the elevator emergency button and have the fire department come and rescue us. It didn’t help that I was getting a bit claustrophobic. Eventually, the fire department showed up. It was honestly a bit embarrassing at first but after they got us out, they didn’t seem surprised or bothered a bit by the situation. Turns out they get this type of emergency often haha. It was still terrible that we were occupying emergency resources but 100% a memorable experience.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We headed to Ross’s place because it was on the way to the bar/club area of Cap Hill. His roommate was home so we couldn’t be too loud. There is a funny video of me wearing a scary “purge” mask trying to scare/freak out everyone. Apparently, it worked. We all headed from here to the Rhino Room.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We ended up going to the Rhino Room and spent our night there. Danny was very nice and paid for my cover fee. Someone got a round of drinks and we waited patiently to get into basement floor of the club. The line was long but well worth it. The vibe was just how I remembered it, jungle-like. I got a round of drinks for the group and we celebrate our reunion.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											As we were all hanging out around the bar, I noticed a cute guy not too far away from where we were. I attempted to set my nervousness aside and go and talk to the guy, but my nerves kept winning out. Danny noticed this, and immediately jumped into wingman mode. He started dancing with the guy and trying to talk to him about me. This was a first for me. Never has anyone made a legit attempt to wingman me in any situation. Honestly, I kinda forgot about the guy I thought was cute and just appreciated the gesture and friendship from Danny. Turns out the guy I thought was cute was straight, so it didn’t work out for me anyways haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We danced a bit longer before leaving the Rhino Room before deciding to retire for the night. Ross and Jack headed back to their respective homes while Danny, Eric, and I went back to Danny’s. I remember mentioning to Danny and Eric on the walk back that I appreciate them as friends. I told them how much it meant to me that they were willing to talk about guys I thought looked attractive, humor me, and even attempt to wingman me! It was the first time anyone had done that and will forever be a fond memory in my life. We all got back to Danny’s and passed out. What a wonderful first day.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got up the next morning, slightly hungover, but ready to tackle the day. I called Noah and told him to come over so that we could start our day. We decided to make breakfast at Danny’s place, so Danny and I made a trip to Whole Foods and bought all the ingredients needed to make a breakfast sandwich with hash browns <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #10]</span>. Funny side note, Danny’s plates, bowls, and cutlery were so nice. Turns out his mom got him a really nice set of each of these. She has a good taste! :) Danny texted her and let her know that I appreciated her purchase. After breakfast, we took Noah’s car to go climb at Seattle Bouldering Project (SBP) <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #11]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We had timed our trip so that we would be around for the day of the competition but the large fee to climb made us hesitate. Next thing we knew, sign ups were full :(. No worries though because we were able to climb in the downstairs area where SBP did not have the competition going on. We also got to climb for free :). Danny, Eric, and I worked on some of the easier problems while Noah attempted harder problems with some of his other friends. There was a cool problem where the end had you sit on a large hold to match the top hold.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we had our fun, we had a quick beer and grilled cheese at the bar/café in SBP. The beer was great and only $4! The grill cheese was less exciting and was around $8. Oooooofff. Quick side note, I saw William Yim here! We interned during the same year at Amazon. Miss that guy :). We left SBP and headed back to Danny’s to grab our stuff for a night at Noah’s place. Side note, Noah’s Tesla is so nice. I want one! Noah’s place was sooo cute! It was tucked away in a suburban area of Seattle. I could tell they put a lot of thought into the layout of the place.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The rest of the night included going to Noah’s co-workers party as a pregame and then heading to a Cash Cash concert. Because of this, we decided to take a shower and dress up a bit for the night. Logan arrived while I was in the shower <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #12]</span>! Ahhh it’s been so long since I’ve seen her! We all headed out to attend Noah’s co-worker’s birthday party. The party was at Olivia’s old apartment that she lived in while interning at FB in the summer of 2018. The birthday party was happening on the communal top floor of this apartment complex. Such a beautiful setting and view.

											</div>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We meet Noah’s co-workers and waited to claim the communal indoor grill area. OMG Noah’s coworker cooked his own birthday meal and it was literally amazing! There was slow cooked carnitas, fresh tortillas, and some other amazing homemade dishes. Funny side note, there was a catered party on the other side of the top floor area. The carter crew gave us a ton of leftover dumplings. They were super duper tasty. We brought a ton of white claws to drink but ended up trying some of the expensive tequila at the party :).
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Eventually, we had our fun and decided to head to the Cash Cash concert. We took an Uber and arrived just as the opening act was ending. The venue was pretty big and packed <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #13 & #14]</span>! As soon as you walked in, the stage was front and center. To the left of the stage was a bar and 21+ area. We hung out at the main dance area for a bit before heading to the 21+ area for a drink. As is typical with all concert venues, the pricing on these drinks was insane! I got our group drinks and we were off and ready to dance. However, as we were leaving the bar area, Danny dropped his drink. I went to go get him another one lol. The bartender lady super nice :).
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We danced, we partied, we sang. I thought didn’t know the group Cash Cash but as they played their music, I started to recognize some of their songs. The night was so fun! Funny side note, I thought the music was too loud, so I got mini bar napkins and stuffed them in my ears lol. It honestly worked sooo well! (forward looking comment: the next day, my friends complained about their ears still ringing from the night before. Looks like I made a good decision hahah). We ended the night and headed back to Noah’s for bed.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we woke up, we hung out in the house for a bit and talked to Sean, Noah’s climbing roommate. We chatted about climbing areas in Seattle such as Index, a super hard climbing area. Woweee Sean is hardcore and I’m sure is a reason why Noah is getting more hardcore now lol. I got a funny video of Noah playing guitar. We picked up Danny and went on a hike near the airport ocean front area. It was absolutely beautiful and quite refreshing from a night of drinking.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We parked and hike a short distance to the main trail. There was a short steep path on the bottom of the hill we were on <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #15]</span>. As we approached the end of the path, the vast Pacific Ocean slowly came into view. The view was breathtaking. It started the rain quite hard which, with the strong breeze, brought down the temperature a significant amount. We were freezing and headed back for the car.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We pervious planned this excursion so that we could hit Ding Tai Fung on the way to the airport. It was in the middle of a mall near the airport. We got there, put down our name, and were told our table would be ready in 45mins. We walked up and down the mall for a bit while we waited. We hit up a candy shop and candle shop. Finally, we were seated and were ready to dig in. OMG Ding Tai was so freaking amazing <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #16, #17, & #18]</span>! Noah was a regular and had a showman like attitude when talking about all the food and ways of eating. I let him do the talking :). This was the first time I had the chocolate filled dumping at Ding Tai. I am not a huge fan of chocolate tbh but it was still objectively tasty!

											We were stuffed by the time we left and could barely walk lol. We got in the car and went to go drop Eric off at the airport. After this, we headed back to Danny’s and dropped him off. Noah and I went to his to grab my stuff since I was planning on staying at Danny’s for the night (it made the most sense since my flight the next morning was at 6am and Noah was 15mins further from the airport. Noah and I decided to go sport climb at the gym Vertical World. Apparently, it is the nation’s first and oldest climbing gym! WOW!

											We rushed over to Vertical World and got around an hour of climbing in before they closed. I quickly went through and passed their TR belay and Lead belay test. Their Lead test was different from what I have done in the past. Other gyms in the bay area just had you fall a little above the first climb and then the test was done. Vertical World had me fall from the last clip and then climb back up to the top, clip the last two quickdraws, and then the test was over. It wasn’t that much harder. I was just nervous because it was different lol.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Anyways, I got the cert! Noah and I went straight to the longest climb in the gym. It was only a 10B but was around 50 meters with a cave at the top. I had to take multiple breaks and couldn’t even finish the route because I was too pumped at the end. My elbow also started to hurt which was bad since it was a reoccurring injury I was trying to get over. We did a few more routes before they closed. That session was so much fun! So happy I have yet another Lead cert under my belt. We left the gym, I called an Uber, and headed for Danny’s place. Got back, hung out with Danny for a bit, and then went to sleep

											<h2>Day 4 & Concluding Thoughts</h2>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											Got up early the next morning, I think around 4am, and called an Uber. I got to the airport, got on my flight, and headed back to Berkeley. This was such a wonderful trip! It was such a joy to see my old Amazon intern friends and relive some of the experiences we had in the summer of 2018. This was the first occasion in my life where one of my friends, Danny, actively wingmaned me. I mean he actually started dancing with the guy I said was cute and tried to have the guy talk to me! This meant so much to me because many of my guy friends don’t fear the idea of LGBTQ+ but they don’t get it/don’t want to talk about it. Danny is such a great friend and I will cherish the memory for the rest of my life. Can’t wait for the next trip!

																	<p>What a fantastic weekend. However, it looks like you have your facts mixed up for Day 1, I believe Eric was the one swamped with work and you were slacking off all day. Looking forward to seeing this crew in Seattle together again soon! :)</p>
