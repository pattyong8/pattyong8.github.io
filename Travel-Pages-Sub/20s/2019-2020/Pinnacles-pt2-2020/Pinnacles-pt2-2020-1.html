											Rishi booked another Pinnacles National Park camping reservation! This time, we went with the Scott Street squad. We climbed, hiked, and explored deeper into Pinnacles than last time. Although it was 106-degrees out, it did not stop us from booling around. Also, we finally climbed Discovery Wall! Gustav and I tag teamed the lead portion of it and Rishi crushed the climb even with his fear of heights. Looking forward to coming back again when it isn’t sweltering.

											<h2>Day 1</h2>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											To start off camping, Rishi and I left a bit earlier than the rest of the crew to grab camping supplies. This included food and propane. The funny part is that we actually arrived 40mins after the other group because we couldn’t find propane and Rishi LOVES shopping XD. We looked at so many knives and other random things haha. Also, we stopped at McDonalds to get food and boy did I over order. I got a 20-piece chicken nuggets and large fry. The interesting part was that we both got more than we ordered because the cashier at the front was so chill about our requests. I remember shoveling down the food as soon as we got it knowing that it would be way less tasty when cold.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Once we got to the campsite, we quickly set up our tents and got ourselves situated. Gustav brought a large water container which came in clutch. For the rest of the night, we hungout in Rishi’s 10-person tent and were our goofy selves. We told scary stories, played games, and took in the nighttime sky.

											The next morning, Rishi, Gustav, and I woke up early to hit the crag. After packing up the climbing gear and eating some breakfast, we were off. The hike was way better than last time since we left around 7am when the temperature outside was still in the 70s <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1 & #2]</span>. The hike felt way shorter this time. I was telling the group that the hike to Discovery Wall was around 5 miles, but it actually turned out to be closer to 3.5 miles lol. I guess it just felt long last time because it was blazing hot outside.

											We decided on the way that it would be better to hit up discovery wall since that was my goal for the day. Once we got there, we took a moment to ooo and awe at the thing before deciding the lead climb Wet Kiss (5.9). Gustav gave it a shot and got past the crux which was right after the first bolt. After the 3rd bolt, Gustav was super pumped, so he came down and I lead the rest of the route. It was actually a great route, flowy climbing, but really chossy looking holds. We each took turns climbing to route before it got way too hot to climb <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3 - #13]</span>. After we were done, I cleaned the route and repelled down <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #14]</span>.

											Funny memory: Rishi climbed after I led the route and set the anchor. It was getting hot but Gustav and I didn’t realize how hot it was getting. Rishi was having trouble on the route and kept saying that his feet were burning. We kept telling him to keep going and that he was being a wus. Once he came down, he was in a daze and actually kinda threw up a bit. Okay that wasn’t good. Gustav and I did our climbing and realized that it was actually super hot. When I went to the top, my shoes were burning! OMG my feet were on fire. Maybe this time I pushed Rishi too hard.

											Once we packed up all our gear, we headed back to tourist trap to meet up with the rest of the squad. Looks like we perfectly timed it since we arrived literally right after they got to tourist trap. We all hungout for a bit and recovered. Our climbing crew went to fill up our waters and I decided I would leave my climbing bag somewhere near Tourist Trap since it was so heavy.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After this we hiked to the caves and hungout there for a bit. It was significantly cooler here than out in the sun. We played some music, explored as much of the caves that was accessible, and got a wonderful group photo. Ryan was making some comments on how the rock looked absolutely beautiful. Totally agreed. We decided we wanted to make the most of the day, so we hiked all the way to the reservoir and to the top of Discovery Wall. Everything was so beautiful.

											Most of the crew wanted to go back to the campsite and kick it so we all ended up leaving early to head back to camp. I didn’t get the amount of climbing I wanted to get in, but it was fine since I knew we would still have a good time back at camp. Carrying the 40-pound backpack was hard on my shoulders. Since it was so hot out and because I was dehydrated, my shoulder started cramping! This has never happened to me before! The rest of the night was full of games, drinks, and food. Surprisingly, our entire group was down to shower which was very nice.

											Got up around 8am the next morning and starting packing stuff away. We made breakfast, ate, and dealt with all the flies and yellowjackets around the campsite. Once everything was put away, I started the drive down south to go home. Unfortunately, after around 3 hours of driving, I had to turn around and head back up north due to some unforeseen consequences.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Overall, this trip was amazing and a great way to get to bond with the Scott Street guys. Pinnacles is now on my list of places the bring my family and even climbing friends to. Looking forward to future adventures with this crew! :)
