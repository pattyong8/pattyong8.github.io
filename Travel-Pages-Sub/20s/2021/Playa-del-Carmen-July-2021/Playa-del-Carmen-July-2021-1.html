												This was the most relaxing trip I have ever been on. Davis and I spent 13 days in Mexico lounging
												by the beach and exploring the beautiful sights in Playa del Carmen. We had 6 days at a very nice
												all inclusive resort in Playa del Carmen called the Royal Hideaway Playacar. The rest of the time,
												we stayed at Meliora by Bunik and went out on adventures each day such as scuba diving, Chichen
												Itza, and cenotes. Traveling with Davis is always something I look forward to and this trip was
												no exception.

											This trip was one of the best trips I have ever been on, hands down. Being able to spend quality time with Davis and completely relax before my new job at Eastdil Secured was extremely important. I had been in Newport Beach with my family for the entire week. Davis and I found time to work out every day in preparation for our time in Mexico. This was because I decided during the month of April 2021 to try and look as cut as I possibly could for Mexico. We also challenged each other to a pullup competition in Mexico. Sadly, this didn’t happen because there wasn’t a pullup bar at our All-Inclusive or hotel.
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 Anyways, we left Mexico on Friday July 23, 2021. Mom drove us to the airport (LAX) a few hours before our flight. We got a red eye because it was the cheapest flight, however, when we arrived at the airport, we were hit with several unaccounted for fees. Turns out the other airlines already included these fees in their ticket price. The airlines we took would have been cheaper if we were citizens of Mexico. Oh well, lesson learned. The good thing was that the attendant that checked us in upgraded our seats to the VIP and extra leg room sections. However, since the airline was a budget airline, the VIP seats were still more uncomfortable than Delta’s economy seats. LOL.
											  </p>

												<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												As we waited for our first flight out of two flights, Davis and I hung out at some comfy ish couches near our gate. We caught up on random life topics and talked about what we were looking forward to the most during our trip. It was during this time that Davis hinted that there was stuff he wanted to talk about that would stay between the two of us. In any case, our plane was boarding, we got priority boarding because of our seats! :) The flight was okay, nothing special. Honestly, the seats sucked, I was hoping that Davis was okay. Turns out his back started hurting from this flight. Once again, no to budget airlines while traveling internationally.

											Our layover was in Mexico City which happened to have one of the best lounges offered on the priority pass, the Grand Lounge. Even though it was 5am PT, we decided to hit up the lounge. It turned out to be a fantastic idea since the lounge chairs were fully flat and we got free drinks. I also signed Davis up for a foot massage and he loved it. I decided to pass since I was not that interested. Quick note, we also had trouble with our baggage, turns out it was too heavy, so I had to move things around. I lost my “approved baggage tag” during the connecting flight section of the trip. They had to reweight my bag which was not fun to deal with.
											 </p>
											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 After another 3-hour flight, we finally arrived in Cancun! OMG Davis and I were so excited haha. Since our all-inclusive resort covered transportation, we awaited our transfer to and from the hotel. Turns out we got a private transfer in an all-black Cadillac. So nice. Our driver was on a mission to get us there as soon as possible. Because of this, he went way over the speed limit and weaved through traffic like a seasoned NY taxi driver. We didn’t mind since it just meant we would get to the resort quicker. On the drive over, we kept seeing some amazing resort entrances. I knew our resort wouldn’t have the most grandiose entrance since our all-inclusive was less modern, however, the service and food were the differentiator.

											 We finally arrived! Our resort was in a private gated community near 10th Avenue. You could tell there were several established all-inclusive resorts beyond the gates. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the doorman. Mariana helped us with check-in and pointed us in the direction of the beach. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the double bedroom we requested but neither of us minded that much. I was able to speak to the manager of the establishment and he upgraded us to a single bedroom that was not more than a few feet away from the beach. Honestly, it was very nice of him to accommodate us, and we really appreciated him.
											  </p>

												<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												We immediately went to the beach and boy, was it freaking amazing. Holy shit. I must give myself credit when I say this resort was likely the best all-inclusive resort in Playa del Carmen for chill vibes, beach/pool access, and service. The infinity pool that perfectly met the edge of the ocean, white sand beaches, and beautiful palm trees were absolute paradise. Since we were not able to check into our room yet, we brought our personal bags with the valuables that we wanted to carry with us. After spending a few minutes on beach loungers under the sun, we went to the Grill to eat lunch. For lunch, we had fish dishes and calamari. Honestly, both dishes were not great which made me sad since this resort was supposed to be known.

												 We hung out on the lounges on the beach for the rest of the day. The weather was perfect, the ocean was beautiful, and the vibe was perfect. I was interested in seeing the other resorts so Davis and I walked along the beachfront to judge the other resorts. Ours was definitely the best. We had a better pool, less people, and a clean beach.
												  </p>

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												 Dinner time finally rolled around. I made reservations for the best restaurant on the property. It was a classy Mediterranean restaurant called Ventanas. I was literally so excited the entire time we were there and Davis could sense it. He made sure to mention afterwards that it made him happy to see me happily in my foodie element haha. I made Davis drink wine. Funny part was that he made me finish my glass of wine and then switch with him so it wouldn’t look like he didn’t drink any. After we switched, a waiter sneaked up behind him and poured him another glass LOL. Davis was so distraught haha. The food was a good 4/5. Not amazing but not bad at all. The star of the meal was the octopus. It was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delightful. I was more excited at the fine dining experience we got. Overall, an amazing first day!

											Day two! I happened to wake up around 7am so went to go see if there were any open loungers. By the time I got out, there were only 2 pairs of loungers left and not in ideal places. Davis and I were not that picky so I knew the loungers I picked would do for the day. After putting towels on the chairs with a personal item (this was how loungers were reserved), I went back into the room to sleep a little more. Eventually, Davis and I got up around 11am and decided we should go use the loungers and see what was going on.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We sat by the loungers for a bit before grabbing lunch. We decided to mix it up and get other dishes since the lunch from the first day was subpar. I tried the fish tacos and omg, they were incredible. Super moist fish with perfectly acidic slaw. It was the perfect start to the day and my new favorite dish at the resort. Davis got a pizza that he stated was average. After our quick lunch, we grabbed ourselves a few drinks from the bar and lounged for the rest of the day. Davis and I just chatted most of the time. Conversation is so easy between the two of us. That’s why we are best friends. I made Davis try a mixed drink that had the colors of the Mexican flag. Turns out it was terribly strong so neither of us liked it haha. It was this day that we figured out that Davis LOVED the pina coladas! I made sure to get him a few haha. Lots of lounging, reading, and hanging out.

											Because we got up relatively late, dinner was upon us in a handful of hours. We went back to the room to shower, relax a bit, and get dressed for dinner. Tonight dinner was at Palazzo, the resort's Italian restaurant. The food was 4/5. The carpaccio was the highlight of the night. The braised lamb shank was also amazing. However, I was underwhelmed with the soup, mussels, and pasta. The salmon in the pasta was quite dry and the soup was extremely bland. It was still super fun! The desserts were also super fun! I got a baked alaska. I had no idea they lit alcohol on fire and poured it onto the dish! So cool.

											Afterwards, Davis and I decided to grab a few drinks at the resort bar. This bar had a lounge area with a pool table and TVs. There were UFC fights being played so I snapchatted Rishi to show him haha. After grabbing a few cosmopolitans, Davis and I played a game of pool. I was kicking Davis ass for the first part but then he slowly came back. At one point, Davis created an extremely tricky setup for me. Basically, I only had the black ball left and couldn’t scratch it else I would lose the game. Davis set it up perfectly to where he has 3 of his balls blocking a direct shot. The only way for me to stay in the game was to hit the white ball off of a side wall perfectly to hit the black ball. GUESS WHAT. I FREAKING CRUSHED IT AND STAYED IN THE GAME!!! Showed Davis who was boss. :P I ended up winning the game and gave Davis a hard time the rest of the night.

											Day 3 was the first day that Davis started trading in the mornings. He got up earlier than I did to grab loungers. I went to join him a few minutes later. He was able to get some absolutely killer loungers by the main infinity pool. The cooler colors of the morning sunrise beautifully complemented the tiles of the pool floor. It was here that we met a few of the other hotel guests, a couple from Louisiana and a girl from Arizona. They were extremely friendly and we chatted with them throughout the day. Davis and I got fresh coconuts! I don’t think Davis was a fan, I thought they were good!
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 I couldn’t get over how picturesque our resort was. Literally paradise. At one point, the massage staff was offering free 5 min tester massages, I literally dragged Davis with me to try it haha. Gave me the idea of grabbing the massage oil later. We got the same lunch we had been getting for the last two days. I actually started crushing can’t hurt me and easily finished the book by the end of this day. Davis and I decided to book club some of the chapters and dive deeper into the topics. There were some parts of the book that I really related to. Overall, a very good book and one I will likely read again. Davis and I also got to talk about a few personal matters. I am so glad we are here for one another and actually understand/care about what either one of us are going through.

											We went to Ventanas again that night. Honestly, the second time around was not as good. I got different dishes and they were pretty bad. The steak dish I got was extremely tough. 100% the toughest steak I have ever had. The gnocchi was seasoned well but the vegetables were subpar. Got the octopus again and that was super dank. Davis opted out of getting wine this time around haha. I decided on Ventanas again because it wouldn’t be open again for the rest of our stay. After dinner, Davis showed me the TV show Chuck. He was a huge fan and wanted me to give the first episode a try. Honestly, it was pretty good and we ended up watching two episodes. Davis and I had the same feeling about the trip. It was time for us to have quality time. It didn’t matter what we did. It was just fun hanging out together.

											On our fourth day, we started eating breakfast. Honestly, the resort's options were not half bad! They had an omelette station and amazing hash browns! I even gave their chia seed pudding a shot. Something about what I ate did not sit well in my stomach because sometime later that day, I got food poisoning. Like every day before this one, we soaked in the sun on the white loungers. Davis wanted to meet up with Dr.Stocks later that night. I did not know how I was going to be able to handle it with my stomach but I decided it was important for Davis to see his mentor in the trading world. Although I knew he could go himself, I also knew he would like it more if I could go.

											We scheduled an early dinner at Ventanas. The dishes I got were actually amazing even with my food poisoning. Eating all of it was likely not a good idea haha. I had two lamb dishes and they were both very tasty. It was my second time getting the land shank and I was not disappointed. After eating dinner, Davis and I went back to the room and got ready to go out. On our way out, we decided we needed to acquire bug spray and sunblock. The options near the hotel were way too expensive so we decided to look elsewhere. We decided to walk to meet Dr.Stocks instead of calling a Taxi and figured he could help us acquire these items.

											 We met Dr.Stocks at a Starbucks near the main part of the city. He was very nice and seemed to have good intentions. He asked us if we wanted to explore the “real Mexico”. We happily obliged. We walked a few blocks West outside of the tourist zone to a famous Taco restaurant called El Nero. Even though my stomach was in a terrible shape. I could not pass up the opportunity to try some of the best tacos in Playa del Carmen. I decided to buy Dr. Stock’s tacos since he has been treating Davis so well. El Nero was out of most types of taco meat so we ended up getting El Pastor tacos. They were not my favorite but still very yummy. Unfortunately, those tacos put me over the edge and my stomach went very quickly downhill. Davis and Dr.Stocks shot a cool instagram story with boba and the chant from the Wolf of Wallstreet.
											  </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 After dinner, Dr.Stocks took us to 10th Avenue to see the tourist sights. He showed us a hidden cenote at the bottom of a rug shop. That was so cool and a hidden gem on 10th street. While walking, I could tell my stomach was about to implode. I told them and we headed to a nearby mall where I threw up in the bathroom stalls. Food poisoning is never fun. Honestly, it was a relief to get the food out of my system. When I came out of the restroom, I saw Dr.Stocks and Davis in a deep conversation. Because of this, I decided to walk around the mall by myself for a bit. I explored a clothing store, tequila/chocolate store, and a formula 1 racing simulation. I remember while passing by that store front, the revving of the engines actually made me jump. The volume was so loud haha.

											 They eventually got up to look for me when they finished talking. We thanked Dr.Stocks for showing us around and parted ways. One of my favorite memories was when we were walking back with Dr.Stocks. We were walking on 10th Avenue when I noticed a group of three children performing street music for the tourists. I immediately knew that Davis was thinking about giving them money because that’s his personality. Without saying anything, I reached into my pockets and grabbed the change we had, said nothing to Davis, he turned to me, opened his hand and I dropped the change in his hands. He then put it in their donation hat. This is probably the most in sync moment we have ever had in our lives. Was a nice feeling that we know each other that well.
											  </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 On the way back I asked Davis about what they talked about. He shared a number of things with me and we had another heart to heart on the way back. I am glad I was able to be there for that and that Dr.Stocks was able to give advice on the topic. Davis said he appreciated me for being there as a bigger brother and that I was a large part of his life. I told him it was literally the same feelings back. We are best friends. Once I got back, I threw up a bit more before showering and spending more time talking with Davis. I reminded him I would always be there for him and that he was one of the most important people in my life.

											This was the first day we got loungers with the mini sinkpool. To be honest, these were way more preferable because they were private and away from everyone else. We were also right on the beach which gave the seats a feeling of luxury. We got a little sunburnt over the last few days so we put on more sunblock and did a better job of staying in the shade. It was on this day that Davis got really into “Can’t Hurt Me”. He was reading faster than I have ever seen him read. I was very excited to see him take such an interest in the book. Since we were closer to the beach, locals would constantly come up to us trying to sell different items. There were even a few people that were trying to sell drugs lol.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We chatted throughout the day and transferred from our loungers to the pool every hour or so. We started getting pails of ice with water bottles each day which gave us a constant source of hydration. It was on this day that we discovered the hot tub. Davis always thought it was another plungpool but turns out it was just a larger hot tub. Davis was a fan so we spent a good hour there before heading back to the room. To get ready for dinner.

											For dinner, we went to Spices, the Mexican restaurant on the property. Davis said this was one of his favorite places we have gone to yet! The vibe was more relaxed and the food was great! I would give it 4/5. The ribeye tostada was amazing and the desserts were to die for. Davis actually got a drink when we ate! We also got our fair share of cosmopolitans. Davis really liked his fish and said it was his favorite dish up until that point. Too bad we were only eating there once.

											Another day by the beach loungers with the private plunge pool. We were trying to soak in every last bit of time we had at the resort. You can tell that we were relaxing super hard because I do not have much to journal about for this day lol. The highlight of the day was going to the Japanese restaurant called Azia. We got the private dining room with the bamboo sliding doors. It was honestly so cool. Turns out this was our favorite restaurant on the property. The sushi wasn’t amazing but good enough. OMG the oxtail curry was to DIE FOR. So much oxtail and the curry was so rich. I told Davis we needed to go the next day, no exception. I also had the restaurant staff sing happy birthday to Davis even though it wasn’t his birthday. I just wanted to embarrass him haha. It worked LOL.

											This was our last day at the all inclusive. Mixed feelings because on one hand, I was ready to explore Playa del Carmen and get my scuba diving certification. On the other hand, I really enjoyed just relaxing everyday and spending some very welcomed quality time with Davis. I need more of him in my life. Since it was our last day, we decided to do the ruins biking tour. Turns out we got a private tour with Alfanzo since no one else signed up that day. Alfanzo showed us all the amazing ruins nearby and told us about the history of the area. He also took us through 10th Avenue, pointed out his favorite taco stand, and even went out of his way to bike us past the hotel we were going to after the all inclusive resort later that night. We made sure to tip him well.

											After the tour, Davis and I played a game of ping pong. Davis beat me but by a slim margin. We spent the rest of the day hanging out on loungers near the beach. We basically soaked in every last second of the all inclusive until our second dinner at Azia. We got lucky and our favorite loungers happened to be open! OMG what luck for the last day. Turns out it was best friends day so there were silly filters on snapchat to use haha. I got my typical fish tacos for lunch and just chilled until dinner. Azia was just as good as the time before. So yummy. Oxtail curry. :P. We took a taxi to our new hotel and then went to explore the taco stand Alfanzo pointed out. OMG these tacos were amazing. I knew at that point that I would be coming back haha.
