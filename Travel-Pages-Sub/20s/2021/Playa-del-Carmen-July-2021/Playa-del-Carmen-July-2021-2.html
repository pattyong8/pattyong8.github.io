										This was the first whole day outside of the all-inclusive resort and boy was it a special one! It was the first day of our scuba diving course with Scuba10. It was only the pool session but still so incredibly exciting. We got up early that morning to be at Scuba10 at 8am. We paid for our course in cash to avoid the 4% credit card fee. Our instructor’s name was Miguel and he was awesome. He was super knowledgeable about all things scuba diving and had around 10 years of experience diving around the world. We got outfitted in our diving gear and learned the basics of how to operate our gear.
										 </p>

										<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
										I could tell that Davis was super excited about getting started. It was understandable because I was equally as excited. We were quick learners and already comfortable in the water so we knew it wouldn’t be hard to get up to speed. The pool session was so much fun. I had no idea how divers stayed at a fixed level during their dive. I now know it is because they have their own buoyancy system and moving up and down depends on how much air you have in your lunges. So cool! We crushed day 1 with flying colors. Miguel even said he could tell we were super comfortable underwater. I made sure we got a pool photo before we finished up for the day. Thankfully with this course, there was no classroom time. This was because we did the course beforehand online.

										After diving, we were starving and decided to go grab some yummy seafood. One place on my list was this seafood tostadas shop on 10th. We walked there and explored along the way. We stopped by the hidden Cenote and saw turtles just chilling on the ledge! Eventually we made our way to the restaurant I wanted to go to. It was way out of the way on 10th street and no one was eating there. It was way pricery than I thought it would be but it was very tasty. The raw fish was incredible and was super tasty. Everything was a seafood tostada or taco and super well done. We started the meal with chips and salsa. They individually bagged the chips because of COVID and did not allow us to drink our own water while there. We had to sneakily drink the water haha.

										We got a few salmon, tuna and octopus tostadas. The salmon tostada was amazing. I honestly thought everything else was just okay and overpriced for Mexico. This was our first good raw fish experience in Mexico and it was amazing. I decided to use the habanero salsa which wasn’t spicy at first but got spicier as we continued eating. By the time we finished our meal. My mouth was on fire. We decided to walk around and explore 10th for a bit. On our way to the beach, we stopped by a random artwork museum at the bottom of a hotel. There was a plane buried in the sand! We passed by so many COVID-19 testing sites. They were basically shops/stores that closed down and were converted into COVID-19 testing sites for tourists.

										It was such a hot day that Davis and I were stopping at multiple shops to just escape the heat. We went into a tequila shop that had a mini museum section. We also stopped at Starbucks since I was able to use my Starbucks gift card money. We both got frappuccinos. Davis got a milk flavored one and I got cookies and cream. We went to check out the Hilton hotel I almost had us stay in but we were not able to get in because of COVID restrictions. At this point, we both thought it was way too hot out to do anymore exploring so we decided to head back to the hotel and chill for a bit before dinner.

											For dinner we went to another recommended restaurant on my list. It was another seafood spot. The tacos were amazing but nothing that special. We each got a fried shrimp taco. Davis also got a fried fish and tuna tostada. He really liked them. We started talking about french fries and decided to get a basket while we were there. Tbh, the fries were actually bomb. We created a rating sheet on notes but I doubt we will actually use it. I ate less because I wanted tacos from the taco stand that Alfanzo suggested. Once we left, we headed straight to the stand so I could get my fix. They gave me some consomme which was amazing. Their tacos hit the spot and were so cheap! Less than $1 USD. We then headed back to the hotel to get some sleep before our big scuba diving day in Cozumel.

										<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
										Day 2 of our scuba diving course! Let’s go! When planning this day, Davis and I decided that paying extra to have one of the open water diving days in Cozumel Island would be ideal. This is because Cozumel Island is one of the best places to dive in the world. We got up early for our 8am dive. The boat was one of the only two boats that had clearance to leave from Playa del Carmen for scuba diving excursions. Because of this, we had another group from another shop diving with us. The captain and his crew took care of our air tanks. I had to take a motion sickness pill before leaving since I was worried that I would get nauseous without them.
										 </p>

										<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
										It took us around an hour to get to the first dive spot. OMG the water was crystal clear. So blue and transparent. Davis and I were beyond excited to hop in. We geared up and got ready to enter the water. Before entering the water, we inflated our BC and stepped off the boat. When we first tried to descend, I had trouble finding the best method to equalize my ears. I tried holding my nose and blowing out, swallowing, and even slightly moving my jaw. It took me the first 5 mins to figure it out. I actually needed my instructor to help me down to the bottom since I was putting too much attention into equalizing. Eventually, I figured out the best way that worked for me was to hold the regulator with one hand and yawn/move my jaw in an exaggerated way.

										I finally got the hang of the equalization method and was ready to go. We did a few basic training movements/drills before exploring the reefs of Cozumel Island. It was absolutely beautiful! The coral structures were colorful, complex, and full of life. I had a GoPro so I was able to capture most of the beautiful sights. We even saw a few sting rays! Apparently, they are a rare sight so we felt extra lucky. Our instructor was so skilled at moving around the ocean. He moved effortlessly. Davis and I were comfortable in the water, but scuba diving was slightly different with a slightly different nuance. After around 30 mins, we started our ascent. We had to conduct a few safety stops because our watch suggested we do.
										 </p>

										<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
										Once we got to the top, we figured out that we consumed air very quickly. Miguel said this was normal for first time divers and the more comfortable we got the slower we would consume our air. Davis and I obviously made this into a competition. Around 10 mins later, the other group finished up as well and we headed to the next dive spot. In between these two dives, the captain and crew fed us fresh fruit. Super tasty watermelon and pineapple! The captain had us wait a good 20 mins before our next dive. We ended up making small talk with the other group and snapping a few pictures with our diving squad.

										After 20 mins, we did our second dive! This time, I had no trouble descending to our depth of 50ft. Once again, we saw beautiful sights and were more conscious of our air intake this time. At one point, I was 300 PSI ahead of Davis. I started to ease up on my air intake and instead focused more on the surroundings. By the time we ascended, Davis had overtaken me by 100 PSI! Noooooo! I lost hahaha. Oh well. We also went from 30 mins underwater to around 55 mins! So much more diving! After our second dive, we started the boat ride back. It was much faster than on the way there. We were exhausted. Did not realize how tiring scuba diving would be.

										Once we got back, we asked Miguel for food recommendations. He suggested a place called El Doctorcito near our hotel. Little did we know, this would become our favorite restaurant… We went back to the hotel to freshen up before heading to the restaurant. It was 1 block from our hotel and was way busier than the other restaurants we had been to. Turns out this was the best way to get food recommendations. Just arrive at the place you are vacationing and ask for food recommendations. El Doctorcito was literally amazing! Their ceviche was so fresh and the quality of fresh was sashimi grade. They also had raw shrimp which I couldn’t stop eating. Their fish tacos were also bomb. It was the perfect amount of fry and moist white fish. Davis isn’t a fan of cabbage so he requested his tacos without it.

										We made friends with our server. Her name was Soli and she was a delight. She immediately memorized our order and was extremely attentive. We were so happy with the food that we ordered more tacos and kept eating. The best part was the price! Everything was soooooo cheap. $5 for the whole thing of ceviche. Can’t get a better price anywhere in the states. We were in a food coma so we went back to the hotel to chill out. I ended up taking a solo walk on the beach to sort some feelings out. Didn’t do the best job of talking about them after but everything worked out. Davis knows haha. We ended up going back to El Doctorcito again that night! Had to leave early because of poor wordage and timing but the food was still amazing and we still went out for tacos (literally just for me) afterwards. I decided to try a new taco stand. Their carne asada was way better but their chorizo was just okay. I even took some home because I love them so much. I was so full though haha.

										This was our last day of scuba diving which was a bummer but still exciting because it meant we would be certified by the end of the day! The dive spots would be at reefs near Playa del Carmen. This time there would be less complex coral structures but it would be replaced by more sea life. It was just us and our dive instructor Miguel for the day. It was so cool that every session was basically a 2 on 1. What a fortunate circumstance! When we got to the reefs, we ended up doing a fall backwards entrance vs the step exit we did in Cozumel Island. We descended quickly and got to our max depth of 40ft. We practiced compass navigation and a few other things before taking off to explore the reefs. There were so many fish! I was able to get pretty close and they didn’t dart away.

										At one point, we spotted a turtle and followed it for a little! It wasn’t that big but it was still a rarer sight! It was on these two dives that I started to get the hang of the buoyancy control via the air in your lunges. I was able to control my vertical movement by just breathing in more or less. This allowed me to get closer to the coral and ocean floor that I had been able to before. SO COOL! Davis and I were still having our competition and he somehow managed to beat me each time. I’ll learn to get better and kick his ass next time :P. We eventually headed back and helped carry the equipment we had to the truck. Davis was frantically trying to study for the test. I was comfortable since I actually finished the course haha.

										When we got back to the shop, the last thing we had to do was log our dives and take the certification multiple choice test. We got to work on it together and ended up getting a 96%! The two we got wrong were my fault tbh but neither of us would have gotten 100% because I changed some that Davis would have gotten wrong on his own. We still killed it as a team! We were officially open water scuba diver certified! Wooohooo! Since the day was already coming to a close, we hit up both El Doctorcito and a few of the other famous taco chains (Don Sirloin and El Fogon). Their tacos were honestly not as great as the Taco stands I had been to but it was still nice to try. At El Doctorcito, we specifically requested and waited for a table with Soli. I tried the ceviche with just fish and decided that I liked all raw shrimp better. Since we had a full day Chichen Itza tour the next day, we crashed early.

										We woke up around 6am to meet at the pickup location for our Chichen Itza day trip. It was early but the drive was around 2 hours away so it made sense. Only half of the charter size bus was full. Davis and I sat next to each other. I let him sleep while the tour guides started to tell us about the history of Chichen Itza. I stayed away since I wasn’t that tired. We had to pay for our entry tickets on the bus which was an extra cost I accounted for. Still made this tour one of the cheapest tours online. If the rest of the tour turned out to be anything like the beginning leg of the trip, we found a bargain.

										We eventually got to the city of Valladolid. This was a rural city about an hour and a half outside of Playa del Carmen. The streets were beautiful and the main church area had a colonial touch. We were not allowed to get off the bus because of COVID restrictions. It was still super cool to see a non touristy city. Our next stop was at a community plaza where local descendants of the Mayans had a ceremony waiting for us. This community plaza is where we would be fed, blessed, and buy our souveringers. We started the ceremony by repeating after the queen of the local tribe and getting blessed by the village shaman. We were then each handed a shot of honey syrup. Then we were given baskets and encouraged to grab items from the store. They taught us how to identify real obsidian from fake obsidian. Everything in the shop was real and handcrafted. So cool!

										Davis wanted to grab a few items for his family and Marci. We shopped around and he eventually decided on a few smaller obsidian items. Of course he had to bargain for the price to get it down lower. I told Davis a few things to say and let him to the rest. Let’s just say negotiating is not Davis' natural gift lol. Since he got two pieces, the guy offered that Davis could grab a few of the broken pieces. Davis went and grabbed a small square piece but I knew there were better items in the basket. I went and grabbed an almost perfect medium size sculpture and put it in the basket. Once we got to the front, we got a bit of push back from the person in charge but she eventually let us have the two free pieces. I remember Davis saying he was so nervous and almost thought we were going to lose everything. I am glad we pushed the boundaries because Davis now obtained a really cool piece for himself!

										After paying for the items we headed to the shaman’s blessing area and got the pieces blessed. They were trying to convince Davis to get himself blessed for an extra cost but we weren’t about that. Davis then got his pieces wrapped up for safety and we headed to the buffet area. To be honest, the food was good but not amazing. However, I was hungry so I went for seconds haha. Turns out all the food they made had been cooked via fire pits and buried under hot coals for more than 12 hours. WOW! I asked one of the workers there if I could go check out the cooking spot. They said no but then when I asked our guide, he said to go for it. We went and got some cool photos and explored their cooking processes.

										We then loaded up onto the busses and headed for Chichen Itza! Woot Woot! The front entrance was flat but elegant. There was a mosquito spraying station so I knew we needed to spray ourselves down haha. The ticketing station had a temperature check so I took a selfie of us when we entered for fun. We ended up getting the tour guide we didn’t want since he wasn’t as charismatic but knew he would still have a wealth of knowledge to share. The ruins were huge! We didn’t even get a chance to explore more than 1/5 of the entire place. We focused on the main pyramid and some of the surrounding temples.

										Some of the highlights included all the shopkeepers at the site. They all had the same whistle blowing item that made a jaguar sound when you blew on the pipe. Very interesting to hear. At first we were freaked out by the noise but then it got normal lol. The main pyramid made a cool noise when you clapped in front of the stairs. It was supposed to mimic the noise of a bird the Mayans really liked. Davis and I got so many photos at the temples haha. We timed it and positioned it perfectly to make it look like we were one of the only people there. The Mayan grand ball court was huge and insane to imagine a full game being played there. It was hot. At one point, it started to drizzle a bit and all the shopkeepers sprang into action and covered up all of their items.

										After exploring Chichen Itza, we headed to our final destination, a beautiful cenote on the way back home. Unfortunately, I forgot the name. We started the day off with a tequila tasting that quite literally blew our expectations out of the water. The tequila was fantastic, so smooth and no burning sensation. The most expensive bottle was called El Jefe which went for $200+. It was a 18yr+ aged tequila with a deep but smooth finish. Davis was so surprised that he liked the tequila he drank. He even offered to buy me a bottle of El Jefe which was very sweet of him. After the Tequila tasting, we went to swim in the Cenote. We were required to purchase life vests which sucked but also rules are rules. This is where I made the largest mistake of the trip. I assumed my iPhone 10 was still waterproof and brought it in with me. Turns out Apple only makes them waterproof for a year and then they become water resistant.

										I was able to take a few fun videos before it temporarily broke. I got many of me and Davis hanging out. I got a few for two couples which they greatly appreciated. There were mini fish in the Cenote so I videoed them which was dumb tbh. Also, Davis and I had a competition where we tried to touch a dangling branch of ivy. Davis eventually got it but he had to take off his life vest. There was a platform to dive off of. I did a swan dive and had Davis video it. We left the Cenote pool because Davis was getting cold. On the way up, I tried having Davis take a few photos of me because I’ve never had nice photos to post. He wasn’t great at taking photos but didn’t really try that hard. This frustrated me a tiny bit but it was short lived since it’s Davis. I could never be mad at him for long haha.

										We got a few more pictures at the Tequila tasting building before taking a stroll around the Cenote grounds. We found a random massage chair in the middle of the grounds so I had Davis sit in it and I gave him a mini back massage since his back was hurting. We then rushed back to the bus stop and got to the parking lot as the bus was pulling up haha. I wonder if we would have missed it… We then bussed back and made sure to tip the tour guides before wrapping up a successful Chichen Itza day trip. Davis and I watched Inception on the way back. Davis said he really enjoyed it! Score 1 for Patrick’ movie picks :). I believe we had El Doctorcito, yes again, and a few tacos from taco stands that night. Soli took care of us again and knew our order by heart at this point. Davis loved that he could just walk in and she already knew what to get us.

										This was our last full day in Mexico. Sadly this amazing trip was actually coming to a close. We decided to take it easy and chill at the pool for most of the day. We just read and relaxed. The pool was very nice and had plenty of room since there were not a ton of people. The paint on the pool floor was rubbing off. This worried me a bit but whatever. Toxic paint, here I come haha. We also went to go get our COVID tests at a nearby clinic. We needed a rapid negative result to be able to get back to the states. This clinic was cheaper than the locations on 10th. The nurse really shoved the sample q tips up our noses. Ouch.

										Davis wanted to make sure I got my fix of beef tongue so we went back to the taco restaurant that Dr. Stocks took us to. To be honest, this was the best taco restaurant I had been to in Playa del Carmen. The beef tongue was no joke. They gave a full vertical cut and it was amazing. So tender. Davis wanted me to take some to go but I was already so full. After my fix, we went to El Doctorcito for the 6th time. We told Soli it was our last full day and made sure to get a photo with her. We actually waited longer, again, to get her table. She added Davis on Instagram. Unfortunately, this was the day we discovered Tuna as an item on their menu. Davis was so sad because he loved this dish so much. He said he would have ordered that every time if he knew. I’m the one that ordered it haha.

										The rest of the day was pretty chill. We walked on 10th to grab the souvenir that Davis wanted for Marci. He tried bargaining for the pieces because I told him to. The person he talked to said no but then the receipt was a cheaper price than what the store said. Davis shoved that in my face saying he was a God and that was all because of him LOL. We then headed back to the hotel and chilled for the rest of the night. We tried watching the Tomorrow War on Netflix but it was so bad and Davis was pretty tired so we went to sleep early instead.

										Last day! We grabbed tacos from my favorite taco stand. While there, we observed a travel YouTube influencer filming a food tour with this taco stand as being one of the main locations. I had Davis take some photos but we didn’t care that much. We also made sure to try real Mexican coke since it was our last day. The tacos were amazing like always. Since we had a few hours before our private transport was going to pick us up. We left our luggages at the front and chilled on the roof hammocks for a bit. I then turned the AC on at the gym area and we hung out there for a bit. Eventually, our private transport showed up and we headed for the airport. Wow it was so fancy! The car even had its own wifi!!!

										We tried getting lounge access when we were at the airport but to no avail. There wasn’t one in our terminal. Our flight back was with Delta. It was non-stop which was nice and cheaper than our multiple stop flight to Mexico. I gave Davis the window seat and we watched a few movies on the way home. First we started with Moneyball, which Davis also liked. Another point for Patrick! :) Then Davis picked Good Boys which was a comedy but was so weird. So much crude humor that was honestly uncomfortable to listen to haha. Davis and I kept cringing and yelping in surprise haha. Maybe the yelping was just me lol. We finished with a cooking show where contestants cooked again Bobby Flay. Not my favorite show but it was a perfect amount of time before we landed.

										Overall, this trip was amazing! Top 3 trips in my lifetime for sure. I got some quality time with one of my favorite people on the planet, relaxed for 8 full days, and explored a new country. Top 3 experiences were scuba diving in Cozumel, relaxing on the beach at our all inclusive, and our Chichen Itza day trip. Davis and I were already close but got even closer on this trip. If he didn’t before, I think he now knows how much I care about him and how much he means to me. So nice to have someone in my life that understands me and that I can chat about anything with. I think we both needed this trip. Can’t wait for the many trips to come with my travel buddy!
