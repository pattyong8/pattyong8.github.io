											Davis and I decided to go on a camping trip to Joshua Tree. Davis had never been so we thought it would be a perfect opportunity to explore a nearby national park for New Years. We scrambled over rocks, visited hot springs, and even did some minor climbing! This was also a mini birthday trip since his birthday was a few days after. We did some desolate camping which was a first for me and was super fun. Next time, I will be more prepared! :). Always love any trip with Davis since he’s my best friend and travel buddy.

											And we were off! We left Irvine around 9am with all our camping gear in Davis’s car and started the 3 hour drive to Joshua Tree. Davis had never been so this was an exciting adventure for the both of us; for him to explore and for me to show him around. Our drive over was super fun. We chatted about music and goals for 2022. We started playing the license plate game where we got to punch each other if we saw a plate from another state. We got gas from the Morongo Casino Resort and Spa grounds. We also got In-n-Out since we were there.

											 We finally arrived at the park! We drove straight to the Hidden Valley campground and started exploring the climbing and scrambling. To Davis’s credit, he stuck with me for the most part. I was having fun hopping from rock to rock. Davis was not in cardio shape but followed me haha. We explored a few rock formations and then started looking for a campsite. I was too hung up on the fact that we needed to find a campground that someone would be willing to share. This was because I had never done desolate camping. We probably spent too long looking but it was a learning experience.

									Before leaving, I decided to solo scramble a much harder rock formation. It was likely a 5.4 rating so was basically a down climb. Davis was really worried about me and stood at the bottom watching me scale this massive spire. I was having so much fun. The way down was harder than the way up but I still felt secure the entire time. We also found this super cool rock with a massive hole in the middle of it.

									 It was getting darker so we decided to go into town for some food and snacks. We decided on Domino's Pizza for food and Stater Bros for snacks. We got Domino’s because Davis claimed Pizza Hut was way better but he had tried Domino’s only a handful of times and many years ago. He loved it haha. For snacks, we got the super soft flaky sugar cookies, martinelli's apple cider, and chips. We snacked and ate dinner after re entering the park. We parked at Boy Scout trail and enjoyed our food. Funny anecdote, I took over for Davis on driving as we were exiting the park and accidentally drove through the ranger station without paying. They were holding up a sign but it wasn’t very visible. We didn’t go back after passing because we knew we were coming back anyway. Davis was freaking out haha.

										After we were done eating, we drank our cider and started to gather our things. I brought two sleeping bags in case it got really cold. It was supposed to be freezing. We walked on the trail for about a mile and then went a couple hundred feet off the main path. We found a flat piece of land and staked our tent. I’m glad we had Doug’s lanterns with us as it was super dark and the flashlight that mom gave me was not working that well. Ended up using my iPhone flashlight haha. Setting up the tent was not that big of a deal. We had time to settle our eyes and look up at the stars and boy was it beautiful. Halfway through the night, it got super windy and the tent top cover flew off. Thankfully, I was smart enough to put a rock on one of the stakes in case this happened. I had to get out of the tent and find 3 additional large rocks to nail down our tent top. That was a fun experience. Davis was supposed to hold down our tent top but was too cold so ran into our tent haha.

										The next morning we got up and cleaned up our campsite. It was so different looking at where we camped during the day than at night. We packed everything up and headed back to the car. We started our day with the cavern. I made sure we brought helmets. Davis was loving it until we got to the squeeze chimney. He was super scared of going into the squeeze chimney but I reassured him he would be fine. We got a few photos while going through and got to experience so hard core cavern scrambling.

										 We then brought our helmets back to the car and headed into the Real Hidden Valley. It was just as beautiful as I remember it being. Davis led the charge as we scaled the tallest collection of rocks. This was the point where I started to get some interesting feelings that might have soured a part of the rest of our trip. Davis could tell I was feeling off but we kept exploring. We even went to see skull rock which was crawling with tourists. Yuck haha.

										 At this point, we decided to head to the hot springs. Since it was on the way home, I proposed to Davis that we go home since we saw most of Joshua Tree anyways. We relaxed in the hot springs and I shared what was on my mind with Davis. Took a bunch of courage but I truly believed it would be the best for the both of us. He took it super well and I honestly think our friendship got stronger after this. We decided to head home since we were almost an hour in that direction anyways and were cashed. On the way back home, we were listening to my playlist and singing songs out loud. Nothing changed even though we talked. We were and still are best friends.

										 My mom wanted me to go pick her up from Yiyi’s since she wanted to drink so Davis and I stopped by a Chinese restaurant nearby to eat before I headed over. We picked a Muslim/Chinese fushion which was amazing. Davis got to try some of my favorite Chinese dishes and loved them all. Was really glad we headed home since I was really looking forward to a nice warm shower and comfy bed.

										 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
										 Overall, this trip was monumental for our friendship. I got to express how I really felt and there was mutual understanding from both parties. Davis really is my best friend and being able to spend quality time with him was exactly what I wanted to do for New Years.
