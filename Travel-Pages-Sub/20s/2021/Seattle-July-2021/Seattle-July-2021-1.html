												It had been around a 1½ since I last saw all my friends up in Seattle. Eric, Jot, Mihir,
												and I made plans to visit everyone in Seattle in July. It was so nice to see everyone again
												 and reminisce on the old days. I continue to hold all of these people close in my life even
												 though I do not see them often. Eric and I were able to crash at Danny’s place and hangout
												 together. I got some bouldering in, hung out by a lake, and hit up Rhino room lol.

											When I landed, I met up with Eric at a restaurant at the Airport where we got beers and food provided by
											the Chase priority pass benefit. I was taking full advantage of it and it was well worth it. We had a
											heart to heart about current life on the train to Zennie’s. I am glad I got this time with Eric. We then
											saw Zennie’s new place and then drove to her old place to hangout on her roof. Danny eventually met us
											there and we ended up staying until very late before heading out to the social scene in Cap Hill. Sometime
											in between, we hit up Optimism. Danny and I won a BP game on Zennie’s roof against Noah and Alec. We ended
											up hitting Rhino room that night which was a blast. Mihir didn’t get into the club because he talked to the
											bouncer and apparently was too drunk lol.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We stayed out pretty late. At one point, Danny and I left Eric at Rhino room since he was talking to a girl.
											We tried getting pizza but the place was closed. The next morning, we did brunch with Danny’s girlfriend
											Sabriana. We originally tried to go out for brunch but all the restaurants were packed. :( We ended up
											grabbing groceries and making a fantastic brunch ourselves. We then went to SBP to boulder. Danny and
											Eric were pretty popped after 30 mins so I told them to head out since Zennie was on her way with Marisa.
											We bouldered for a good amount of time before heading to a Vietnamese restaurant. Zennie paid which was very
											nice of her! I love the natural back and forth of our friendship.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											That night we went to another club and partied the night away. We waited in line for around 45 mins.
											While in line, I stuck up a conversation with someone in front of me that was also involved in the world of
											real estate. He gave me some intel for Virginia real estate lol. The next morning, we got brunch with all our
											friends at one of the houses and then headed to Lake Merritt to hangout for the afternoon. I kicked our
											friends across the lake to a platform with a slide since they were not great swimmers. Thankfully, they have
											inflatable donuts. Tried doing a front flip but ended up back flopping. We sat around in the sun. Jack invited
											up back to his place for dinner to eat some wild caught Alaskan salmon he caught a few weeks back. We happily
											accepted his offer.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We went to a super bougie market to grab some supplies. It was so expensive lol. Jack’s place was actually amazing.
											Lots of space and a nice rustic vibe. I made some dank mashed potatoes. I got Iced by Jack lol. We had many
											conversation topics but one memorable one in particular was a conversation around how politics gets brought
											up during family occasions. I personally had never experienced it since I do not have extended family in the
											US. It was funny to see how easy it is to tie anything back to politics. After this we headed back and retired
											for the night. What an amazing trip with some amazing friends.
