											My trip to Paris for the 2024 Olympics with my best friends is one I will never forget. From watching thrilling Olympic events to dining at renowned brasseries, we experienced the full magic of Paris from a unique perspective. We indulged in delicious duck dishes and visited the Chase Reserve lounge perhaps a few too many times. It was the perfect international adventure before starting my new job.

												After spending two weeks in Southern California, I headed back to NYC to pack for my trip to Paris for the 2024 Olympics. I was incredibly excited to explore one of the most famous cities in the world with Quinn, Parth, and Jake. My journey began around 5 PM from Newark Airport on a direct Air France flight. This was the nicest international plane I had ever been on, with comfortable seats, massive TV screens, and even Bluetooth audio, which was a first for me. Instead of sleeping, I watched several movies during the short 7-hour flight. 
												 </p>

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													Throughout the flight, I found myself interacting regularly with a very charming flight attendant. Our conversations were casual; he would ask if I enjoyed my meal and offer me a drink when I got up from the bathroom. Towards the end of the flight, I asked him for a few food and drink recommendations. His heavy French accent made it hard to understand him, so I had him write down his suggestions, planning to look them up later. To my surprise, one of his recommendations was the gay district in Paris! In hindsight, it might have been fun to ask him out while in Paris, but alas.
													 </p>

													 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
														Once I cleared immigration, I headed for the city center of Paris. We all decided to use a temporary 1-7 day unlimited metro pass from the local transportation service. Once I exited the metro station, I noticed that many of the streets near the Seine River were blocked off and guarded by police. Curious about the situation, I approached a group of officers to inquire about the blockage. I also asked them for recommendations on where to eat and drink. They were actually the ones who told me that one of the flight attendant’s suggestions was the gay district. Since I arrived at the Airbnb four hours early, I waited for check-in at a nearby park, enjoying the sight of the city waking up. The park grew more populated as the hours passed, and the weather, in the low 70s, made for a pleasant reading environment.

												Finally, it was time to check in, and I headed to the Airbnb to meet the owner. He handed me the keys and took off for the South of France. Being the first to arrive, I decided to go for a quick run to explore the surrounding area. This turned out to be a mistake as I was sleep-deprived and not a regular runner. I used up most of my adrenaline reserves on this effort and should have saved it for the day's activities. On the bright side, I did get to run along the Seine for a bit.

												Jake texted me on my way back, letting me know he had arrived. I rushed home to prevent him from waiting and took a quick post-run shower. About 45 minutes later, Parth and Quinn arrived. We were all ecstatic to be in Paris together and couldn't wait to explore the neighborhood. We were hungry and started by grabbing lunch at TournBride, a local French café. The menu prices were high, as expected in Paris, though I soon realized that Paris was cheaper than New York and San Francisco. Opting for the duck leg confit with potatoes, I found this to be a staple at most French restaurants. Naturally, we had wine with our meal.

												After lunch, we strolled around the Latin Quarter and made our way to the Panthéon, admiring Paris's beautiful architecture along the way. Every block seemed to feature a monument or notable landmark, a stark contrast to the United States. In need of another drink, we discovered a charming alley filled with cafés and restaurants. Here, we enjoyed beers and coffees while catching up on Quinn and Parth's travels across Europe, giving Jake and me a chance to get to know each other better. A memorable moment occurred when a friendly local overheard our American accents and struck up a conversation, revealing she was also from Southern California. It was interesting to realize how Americans tend to stand out wherever we go.

												We walked past Hôtel de Ville, one of the Olympic celebration venues, and spent about 20 minutes taking photos, milling around, and enjoying the decorations. Next, we headed to the Arc de Triomphe, passing by the Louvre, where we saw a group of locals practicing their dance moves. Tired from a long day of travel and walking, our focus shifted from exploration to food and getting back to the Airbnb. Although our dinner was underwhelming, it was a new dish I had never heard of and was great to try. Parth and I took the bunk room, while Quinn and Jake took the main and trundle beds.

											I slept for 15 hours! It turns out my body really needed the rest. While Quinn had work for the next two days, Parth, Jake, and I set out to explore on our own. Our goal was a picnic at the Eiffel Tower, so we headed to a nearby bakery to pick up some breakfast items. I got a Caesar salad sandwich and a croissant, while Parth picked up a baguette. We then went to a nearby grocery store for meat and cheese. Parth couldn't resist grabbing some fresh-squeezed orange juice as well. Once we had all our supplies, we made our way to the base of the Eiffel Tower.

												Unfortunately, the field below the Eiffel Tower was inaccessible due to the beach volleyball Olympic stadium. In light of this, I decided to buy tickets for a few matches to see this historic setup. We took a few pictures as close to the Eiffel Tower as we could, then found a nearby bench to sit, eat our breakfast, and admire the iconic landmark of Paris. Our sandwiches from the bakery were so filling that we didn't even touch the meat and cheese, which sadly went bad later that day.

												Feeling a bit tired, we opted for a coffee break. One thing I noticed about Parisian cafés is that their cups always have the restaurant's name on the inside lip, as if all cafés get their cups from the same manufacturer. Since we were so far west, we decided to head back to the Arc de Triomphe and admire it up close. On the way, we tried to visit the Place du Trocadéro, but it was blocked off for the opening ceremony. Although it was disappointing not to see the Eiffel Tower from such an iconic angle, we understood the need for high security.

												When we finally reached the Arc de Triomphe, it was even more impressive up close. The detailed stonework and sculptures on the facade were beautiful. Due to the Olympics, guards with assault weapons patrolled the area. We sat and people-watched for a few hours before heading back home to meet up with Quinn. On our way, we strolled along Av. des Champs-Elysées, a famous street lined with department stores and luxury brands.

												Once home, we prepared for dinner and made our way to one of the restaurants on my list, Bouillon Pigalle, a well-known and affordable French bistro with over 300 seats. Despite arriving after 10 pm, there was still a 30-minute wait, showing its popularity among tourists and locals alike. One funny memory is that there was a porn movie theater next door, which became a running joke among our group throughout the trip.
												 </p>		
											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												We were pleasantly surprised by the affordable menu, with starters as low as $3 and entrées priced in the low teens. I ordered the duck and potatoes, which were amazing. This was the first restaurant I'd been to where wine could come in 750ml, 1.5L, or 3L bottles. We tried to order a 3L bottle, but the waiter wouldn't let us, likely thinking it was too much for our group. Instead, we ordered a 1.5L bottle of red wine and a 3L bottle of Perrier. I got a funny photo of me pretending to drink straight from the giant bottle.

												Since the food was so cheap, we ordered dessert as well. Parth found the crème brûlée average, but my dessert—a soft serve puff pastry almond chocolate tower—was to die for. I honestly could have had another. One notable memory was a Parisian gentleman at the table next to us, who managed to order, drink his bottle of wine, and finish his meal within 15-20 minutes. We were all impressed. As usual, we fought over the bill and then decided to explore Pigalle, a lively area of Paris known for its nightlife. We didn't have to go far, as we stumbled upon a karaoke bar next door and went in.

												We definitely chose the right spot for a local experience; almost everyone was French! We noticed several beer towers and decided to order one. When ordering, we were semi-tricked into getting the largest beer tower, which held 5L instead of the 3L we wanted. Nevertheless, we managed to finish it all. While enjoying our beers, Quinn mentioned that his go-to karaoke song was "Chicken Fried." The rest of us secretly put the song in the queue to surprise him. It worked perfectly! The entire table sang along with Quinn, and we had a fantastic time. However, there were definitely better singers before us; one girl performed so well that the entire bar cheered for her. After finishing our beer tower, we headed home, drunk and happy.

												After a night of drinking, the group was feeling the effects, with Jake suffering the most. Since Quinn had to work, Parth and I decided to explore the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur. We left around noon and took the subway, which marked the only time I ever took a bus in Paris. Upon arriving at our final stop, Parth and I began our leisurely hike up to the basilica. Along the way, we paused for a quick coffee break, partly to shake off the grogginess from the previous night. I ordered a latte, while Parth went for an espresso. The café we chose had a charming outdoor patio where we sat, catching up on life, discussing our new jobs, and delving into the nature of political discourse.
												 </p>

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													Post our coffees, we continued our journey. Eventually, we reached the base of the hill on which the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur stands. The entire area was bustling with people. I tried taking a few photos at the base, some of which turned out pretty well, and Parth and I also took a picture together. We then began the ascent up the stairs toward the basilica, pausing to admire the breathtaking views of Paris from the city's highest point. We could spot several key landmarks from there.
													 </p>	 

													 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
														Once inside the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, we spent about 30 minutes exploring, taking our time to appreciate the intricate details of the church. Parth and I couldn't help but notice the somewhat commercial atmosphere, with numerous candles and items for sale.

												After our visit to the basilica, we decided to grab a snack before dinner and headed to Urfa Durum, a small Turkish spot known for its cheap, fresh, and quick wraps. On the way, we passed a candy shop that we later discovered was part of a chain called Pirates Candy. They had some of the largest gummies I'd ever seen, and it took all of Parth’s willpower not to buy a few for the road.

												When we arrived at Urfa Durum, it was clear why the place was so popular among locals. The wraps were around 5 euros and incredibly fresh. They grilled the kebabs over a charcoal grill and baked the wraps in an industrial oven. Watching them prepare the food was a treat in itself. The wraps came out piping hot and were ready to devour. The meat was succulent, and the freshness of the vegetables really stood out. The food was so good that I went back for seconds, this time trying their meat flatbread wrap, which had a spread of beef and sauces. It was just as delicious as the kebab wrap.

												After our meal, we headed back to the Airbnb to check in on Quinn and Jake and to get ready for dinner. Our restaurant of choice was Chez Janou, a popular French spot known for its duck and chocolate mousse—neither of which disappointed. Although we had to wait about 10 minutes, we were quickly seated. A few interesting details: the menus weren't in English, so we had to look them up online and translate them. The tables were so close together that our waitress had to pull out the entire table for Quinn and me to slide into the booth side. We started with a ratatouille, which was served cold. For our mains, Parth, Quinn, and I ordered the duck, while Jake opted for a fish dish. The duck at Chez Janou was the highlight of my trip, perfectly cooked with an ideal fat-to-meat ratio. I could have returned multiple times just for that dish. To cap off a perfect meal, we indulged in some rich chocolate mousse—a sweet end to a great day.

														Day 4 was dedicated to exploring the grandeur of the Palace of Versailles. We left our accommodations around 11 a.m. to make our entry window at noon. Before catching the train, we stopped by our neighborhood bakery for a quick breakfast. I opted for a smoked salmon and spinach pastry, which I was excited to try. However, it wasn't as good as I had hoped; the smoked salmon was baked, making it taste more like cooked fish than the traditional smoked salmon I'm used to in the U.S.
														 </p>
														 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
															After our breakfast, we embarked on the hour-long journey to Versailles, mainly traveling on the RER C train. I managed to catch a much-needed nap on the way, as I’d stayed up late the previous night. My friends woke me up when we arrived—it was the final stop on the RER C route. The entrance to the Palace was just a short 10-minute walk away, and even from a distance, the sheer size of the grounds was impressive. We started our visit with a group photo before heading into the main palace.

														The moment we stepped inside, I knew this visit would be special. The interior was breathtaking, with a stunning array of paintings, sculptures, and historical artifacts. It felt like wandering through a maze of history. I’m not usually a history buff, but I’d watched a documentary on Napoleon recently, which helped me appreciate the significance of what I was seeing.

There was even a video presentation detailing the numerous expansions that took place under his reign. Despite the crowd in the first section of the palace, I took my time to absorb as much as I could, reading the descriptions and admiring the exhibits. The only downside was the stifling heat and the resulting body odor, which made the lack of ventilation all too apparent.

														As we continued our tour, we came across a room filled with knight armor and weapons, which led us directly into the Hall of Mirrors. This iconic hallway, adorned with paintings depicting wars and historical events, felt more like an art museum than a historical site. After completing our tour of the Hall of Mirrors, we headed to a café within the palace for a quick break. I wasn’t very hungry, so I just ordered a latte. Unfortunately, as we were leaving to eat outside, I realized that the lid on my coffee cup was faulty, causing coffee to spill onto my white t-shirt—definitely not something I wanted to deal with during the excursion.

														I quickly made my way to the nearest bathroom to clean up. It was quite the scene: the cleaning ladies chuckled at my frantic scrubbing, I was surprised by how well the stains were coming out, and I learned from the barista that tap water in France is safe to drink—a helpful tip for future reference. Oddly enough, the damp shirt ended up being a blessing in disguise, helping me stay cool in the hot weather.

															After getting my shirt as clean as possible, I reunited with Quinn, who happened to be nearby. We weren’t sure how he got separated from the group, but I was glad to run into him. Together, we wandered around the palace grounds, trying to locate the others. Quinn used his unlimited data plan to track down Parth via the "Find My Friends" app. Apparently, Parth had also lost track of Jake, so everyone was on their own little adventure. As we strolled by a fountain, we noticed a water show reminiscent of the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Unexpectedly, we also encountered a group of soldiers with automatic rifles—a reminder of the increased security due to the upcoming Olympics. I later learned that some Olympic events would be held on the palace grounds, which explained the heavy presence of security personnel. Paris had brought in 30,000 officers from over 44 countries to ensure safety during the games.

														While Quinn and Parth headed back to the main palace, I decided to explore the rest of the grounds on my own. I quickly realized I had only scratched the surface of what Versailles had to offer. A few miles away, I discovered the Estate of Trianon, a serene area that included three buildings once used by royals and guests for private retreats. The Queen’s Hamlet, one of these buildings, was particularly enchanting, with its thatched roofs and cobblestone paths—like something out of "Lord of the Rings." I spent some time wandering the grounds of the Grand Trianon, enjoying the solitude. In one quiet corner of the gardens, I found myself completely alone, unable to hear or see another visitor. I lay in the grass for a while, soaking in the peaceful atmosphere—perhaps much like the estate's residents would have done in the past.

														During my exploration, I met a charming guy who was looking for directions to the Queen’s Hamlet. Since I knew the way, I guided him there, and we struck up a conversation. He was a photographer from China, in France for work and a bit of vacation. We talked and walked together for about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, he mentioned he had a girlfriend, which dashed any hopes of a romantic moment. As the grounds were closing soon, we parted ways; he took a shuttle back to the main area, while I opted to walk. I had already told my friends to head back to Paris without me, as it would take me another 45 minutes to return to the main palace grounds. This turned out to be the day when I racked up the most steps during our trip.

													Before heading to the train station, I explored an area near the entrance that supposedly had an old tennis court. I couldn’t find anything resembling a tennis court, so I assumed it had been built over. The train ride back to Paris was peaceful, as the train was almost empty, likely because it was midweek and close to the palace's closing time. My friends sent me their location in the Latin Quarter, and I met up with them for dinner at Pink Mamma, a well-known Italian restaurant in Paris. We had to queue outside for about 30 minutes, so Parth made a reservation just in case. It turned out to be a good move, as the hostess informed us that without a reservation, we’d likely be seated at the bar. Once our reservation was confirmed, we were led to a table on the second floor, where the open-concept kitchen allowed us to watch the chefs at work.

													 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
														The prices at Pink Mamma were surprisingly affordable, a trend we noticed throughout Paris compared to New York. I shared a burrata starter and ordered their signature truffle pasta, topped with freshly shaved black truffles. Quinn got a pizza, Parth chose another pasta dish, and Jake opted for a light tomato salad. My truffle pasta was incredible—perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. It was easily one of the top three dishes I had in Paris. Unfortunately, Parth’s pasta was undercooked, and Quinn’s pizza was just okay, so I’m not sure if the restaurant left as strong an impression on them. However, they agreed that my dish was a standout.
