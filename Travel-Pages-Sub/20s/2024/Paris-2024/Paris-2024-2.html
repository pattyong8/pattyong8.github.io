												It was another slow start to the morning. Parth and Quinn, having already spent a month traveling before this point, decided to take a day to relax. Jake joined them, leaving me to explore Paris solo. It was the perfect opportunity to soak in the city at my own pace.

												 </p>

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													My afternoon began near Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, in the northern part of Paris. As was customary, I grabbed an espresso from a random café on Rue de Belleville and settled in for some people-watching. It wasn’t the most picturesque café, but the scene was authentically Parisian. A group of handymen painted the facade of a nearby shop, while patrons smoked, sipped their coffee, and chatted languidly. It was a small but meaningful glimpse into everyday life here.
	
													 </p>

													 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
														Once my coffee cup was empty, I made my way to Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. From the map, it seemed like an expansive green haven, but in reality, it was smaller and rougher than I’d imagined. Overgrown plants and graffiti gave it a slightly neglected feel. I strolled through quickly, though I did pause to watch a spirited soccer match in a small caged area. The players' skill and ease in such a confined space were mesmerizing.

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													Continuing along Rue de Belleville, I stumbled upon a vibrant shopping area. It wasn’t as touristy as central Paris, and I loved its local, unpretentious charm. A few spots stood out: a vintage shop called Kilo Shop, a grocery store handing out free samples of muscle milk (unexpected, but appreciated), and a store called Habitat, which amusingly shared the name of my friend Jack’s first startup.
	
													 </p>

													 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
														The street eventually led me to Esplanade André Tollet, a modest local landmark. I snapped a quick selfie and headed toward my main destination for the day: Marché des Enfants Rouges. This historic outdoor market is home to one of the city’s best sandwich shops, Chez Alain Miam Miam.
		
														 </p>

														 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
															The market itself was bustling and vibrant, with stalls offering everything from fresh seafood to smoothies. The energy was contagious, and the crowd was mostly locals—a promising sign. I joined the line at Chez Alain, which moved slowly but felt more like an experience than an inconvenience. The owner worked the register himself, chatting animatedly with every customer and folding receipts into tiny birds that “flew” into your hand. When it was my turn, we discussed his favorite sandwich, my travels, and how I discovered the shop. His passion was infectious.

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													I ordered a pastrami sandwich and was invited to sample a few cheeses before finalizing. True to French form, the sandwich was decadent, with an almost comical amount of melted cheese. I thanked the staff and found a nearby park bench to enjoy my meal. The sandwich was every bit as delicious as promised—worth every calorie.

														With a few hours to kill before meeting up with the guys for our timed entry into the Paris Catacombs, I wandered through the city. I visited a couple of free museums and let time slip away until I found myself at a café near the Catacombs entrance. Jake joined me for a pre-drink—an Aperol spritz for me, ice cream for him—before we descended into the eerie underground.

												The Catacombs were both fascinating and macabre. With thousands of human bones lining the walls, the audio guide provided historical context that added depth to the experience. It was humbling and surreal to walk through such a unique piece of history.

													Afterward, we found a lively bar nearby, where we spent the evening drinking and playing cards. Quinn, the self-proclaimed game master, won every round of hearts. Dinner followed at a famous crepe shop, where I indulged in both savory and sweet options. The crepes were divine, and the open-air ambiance added to the charm.

														Post-dinner, we ventured into the nearby gay district, drawn by its lively atmosphere and vibrant energy. Though most of the bars didn’t pique my interest, one stood out with its sky adorned with rainbow umbrellas. We grabbed a drink, enjoying the moment and each other’s company.

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													As the night wound down, I met up with a Parisian I’d been chatting with earlier. Spontaneity took over, and soon I was at his apartment with a couple of his friends, sipping champagne and soaking in yet another layer of Parisian life. It was a perfect ending to a day filled with exploration, food, and connection. Plans were made to meet again the next morning, but for now, I left with a smile and memories to cherish.

											Day 6 marked the beginning of the Olympics! The much-anticipated opening ceremony was scheduled for that evening, but my day started with a semi-official date with the Parisian I had met the night before. He had suggested a local restaurant favored by Parisians, known for its affordable yet delicious dishes. We both ordered the same chicken dish—tender braised chicken in a rich gravy, accompanied by perfectly cooked potatoes. Since he planned to show me around afterward, I decided to treat him to lunch.

												</p>

												<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													After our meal, we ventured to Le Bon Marché, an upscale mall filled with luxury goods and high-end fashion. We browsed colognes, tried on some extravagantly priced clothes, and explored the unique gourmet food market. It was a blend of indulgence and curiosity, a window into Parisian elegance. Unfortunately, the mall closed earlier than usual due to the Olympics’ opening ceremony, cutting our adventure short.

														</p>

														<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
															With the afternoon winding down, we returned to my Airbnb, where we ended up napping for a bit. When it was time for him to leave, I made plans to meet him again later that night and headed off to meet the guys for the evening’s festivities.

											The park where we planned to watch the ceremony from a free public viewing area was already packed by the time I arrived. I had to navigate through a dense crowd to find the guys, who had managed to snag a prime spot at the top of the stands. It seemed like the perfect place to watch the ceremony—until the rain started. The downpour was an unfortunate twist for such a monumental global event, but as they say, the show must go on.

												</p>

										<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We decided to leave the park and find a restaurant where we could eat and watch the ceremony. The place we ended up at was near our Airbnb, but since we arrived after the ceremony had started, all the prime seats with TV access were taken. Our table was outside, partially blocked by columns, so we had to take turns standing inside to catch glimpses of the action.

											As the evening wore on, Quinn called it a night, but Jake, Parth, and I stuck around for another hour before heading home. Sadly, we missed Rafael Nadal carrying the torch—a moment Parth had been eagerly anticipating. He was understandably disappointed. My night took an unexpected turn—a sort of “Uno reverse card” moment. I met up with my Parisian friend as planned, but after about 30 minutes, it became clear that our expectations for the evening didn’t align. I decided to head back early to prepare for what I knew would be an exciting day of Olympic sports watching.

														For most of the Olympics, I found myself going solo while the rest of the guys stuck together. Their focus was on tennis, while I was eager to watch water polo—not only because I played the sport but also because it offered some of the most affordable tickets.

															<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
																My first event was women’s water polo: USA vs. Spain. I was especially excited to watch Maddie Musselman, a friend of my brother from high school, represent Team USA. The game was full of memorable moments: I held up a replica Olympic torch for a fun photo op, snapped pictures of Maddie from the front of the stands, and scoped out the best seats for the next day’s men’s water polo match. Team USA dominated the game, earning a decisive victory.

														Afterward, I made my way to Chez Gladines, a cozy restaurant famed for its cheesy goat dish. Let me tell you—this was one of the most incredible meals I had in Paris. The combination of creamy goat cheese, potatoes, and rich sauce was nothing short of heavenly. Meanwhile, the guys were having an equally great time at tennis, where they got to watch Carlos Alcaraz play live.

														While they were at the match, I decided to wander along the Seine, which had been opened to the public for the Olympics. It was fascinating to see parts of the opening ceremony sets still in place, Notre Dame in the midst of its restoration, and the grandstands from the ceremony. The walk gave me a deeper appreciation for how Paris blended its historic charm with the excitement of hosting the Games.

On our way back to the Airbnb, we were treated to a glimpse of the Olympic flame suspended from a hot air balloon—a surreal and magical sight to cap off the evening. With the day winding down, we called it a night, ready to dive into another thrilling day of Olympic events.

												This was, without a doubt, the most iconic day of the Olympics for me. I decided to splurge on tickets for beach volleyball, which took place in a stunning stadium overlooking the Eiffel Tower. It was easily one of the coolest sporting events I’ve ever attended. The weather was absolutely perfect—bright, sunny blue skies with barely a cloud in sight. My Category B seats were fantastic, offering a great view of the court and the action.

												The match I watched turned out to be unexpectedly hilarious. It was Italy versus the Netherlands, and one of the Italian players was infamous for his “airball” serve. I’d never seen a serve like that before, and the crowd couldn’t get enough. Somehow, he landed it successfully almost every time, and Italy ended up winning the match. The combination of the incredible venue, perfect weather, and entertaining gameplay made it unforgettable.

													After a few matches, I decided to head to the Chase Sapphire Reserve Lounge, which was located on a boat on the Seine River. The lounge opened at noon, and I wanted to make sure I got in, as these lounges are typically known for being hard to access. To my surprise, it turned out to be much easier than expected—we could essentially drop by anytime during the week. While the food options weren’t extensive, there were plenty of small bites to enjoy. Each visit came with a free drink token and a small gift.

												This time, I snagged a lounger with a drink in hand and settled in to watch a variety of sports on the lounge’s TVs. A funny memory was when a customer ordered a glass of white wine from teh bar and was offended with how small the serving size was. He refused to take it and left it at the bar. The bartender was going to take it back but I offered to take it and he gave it to me. Lucky me! The day’s highlights included an incredible ice cream selection and smoked salmon bites—absolutely delicious. By 1 PM, I left for my second water polo match of the Olympics: USA Men’s vs. Italy. It took about an hour to get to the venue, but I arrived early enough to find my seat and take in the atmosphere. Watching players I had competed against in high school now representing Team USA on the Olympic stage was surreal and inspiring.

												Midway through the first quarter, I noticed an open seat much closer to the pool and decided to move. Coincidentally, I ended up sitting next to a family from Orange County who were huge fans of Johnny Hopper, one of the players. We hit it off and cheered on Team USA together. Sadly, the men’s team lost to Italy after making a few costly mistakes. Still, the experience of watching the game live was unforgettable.

Before heading to the lounge, I met up with Noah and Monica outside the venue. They were there for the France vs. Croatia match, but the stadium was sold out, and I couldn’t buy a last-minute ticket. Noah and Monica, however, scored incredible seats thanks to Monica’s dad, who works security at every Olympics.

												Parth and I started the morning with chocolate croissants from a nearby bakery, and they were absolutely delicious. Quinn didn’t join us because he was busy hitting the gym. In fact, he was so committed to his fitness routine that he got a gym membership just for the trip. The dedication was admirable, though it did mean he missed out on the croissants.

I was thrilled—it’s one of the centerpiece competitions of the Olympics. We spent a bit too long enjoying ourselves at the Chase Sapphire Lounge and ended up rushing through the subway and security to make it to the venue in time. By the time we arrived, the competition was already in its second rotation, but the energy inside the arena was palpable.

												The USA men’s gymnastics team was holding their own, staying in contention for a medal, which was exciting given they hadn’t medaled in years. Behind us, a family of passionate Team USA fans cheered enthusiastically. Their younger son, clearly a budding gymnast himself, brought an extra layer of excitement to the experience. Over the course of the next two hours, the competition became a nail-biter.

												The crowd erupted with chants of “USA!” and “Gā yóu!” (Chinese for “let’s go!”) as emotions ran high on both sides. The Chinese team looked visibly devastated by their unexpected loss, while Team USA radiated joy and pride. Witnessing it all unfold from some of the best seats in the house was an unforgettable experience.

												After the competition, we made our way back into the city for dinner at a meat-forward restaurant I had been eager to try. Quinn wasted no time making it an event, ordering two bottles of wine before we even had water at the table. Unfortunately, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm, and I quickly regretted not ordering the ribeye. My luck turned, though, when the staff forgot my entrée and upgraded me to a better dish for free. Parth, thankfully, found a great non-beef option, so we all ended the meal satisfied.

													After dinner, we decided to keep the night going with a drink at a nearby bar. Our initial attempts were thwarted as several places we tried were closed, but we eventually found a spot that seemed open on our maps. That spur-of-the-moment decision led to an unexpectedly memorable experience. The bar we stumbled upon wasn’t just open—it turned out to be a hidden gem beloved by locals. With many Parisians out of the city for the Olympics, the usual buzz was subdued, leaving the space quieter and more intimate. This worked in our favor, as the owner himself stepped in to serve us.
													 </p>

													 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
														Our conversation with him turned into a highlight of the evening. He shared his journey into the hospitality industry, the inspiration behind his bar, and his plans for a new food venture next door. His enthusiasm and storytelling gave us a genuine glimpse into Parisian life beyond the tourist experience. To make the night even more special, he offered us a free shot of a new infused spirit he was experimenting with, designed to taste like butterscotch. While the flavor wasn’t perfected yet, it showcased his creativity and generosity, leaving us with a lasting impression of his passion and a night that felt uniquely Parisian.

												 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													With the excitement of the day behind us, we headed back to our accommodations to rest up for the next day’s women’s rugby match.

													We started our morning a bit late, but with the women’s rugby match not until 2 PM, we had plenty of time. Quinn’s family friend had generously provided us with tickets again, making our Olympic experience truly unforgettable. For lunch, we went to Bouillon Julien, savoring our last authentic French meal in Paris. I opted for the pâté as a starter and steak frites as my main course. It was incredible to enjoy such high-quality cuisine at an affordable price, and it reinforced my desire to return to Paris just for the food. Afterward, we made our way to the rugby stadium, which was conveniently located next to the water polo venue. Fun fact: the water polo stadium was one of the few purpose-built facilities for these Olympics, underscoring Paris’s commitment to hosting one of the most sustainable games in history.

													The rugby stadium itself was massive, making it a bit of a challenge to find our seats. Initially, we discovered others sitting in our spots, so we improvised, sitting in random seats nearby. Parth and Quinn managed to find two seats together across the aisle, but when the rightful occupants arrived, they had to move, sparking a small seating fiasco. Meanwhile, I lucked out and stayed in my spot the entire time. After watching four quick games under the sweltering heat, we decided to retreat to the Chase lounge for one last visit. We arrived just in time to enjoy gold-foiled Tomahawk steaks with a potato ring and sauce, a luxurious treat I shamelessly indulged in repeatedly. Once satisfied, we said our final goodbyes to the lounge and set off for dinner.

													Craving something different, we opted for ramen at a popular spot near our Airbnb. The wait was over an hour, so we wandered the area, soaking in the ambiance of our last evening in Paris. When our table was ready, we entered a restaurant that felt like a portal to Japan, complete with a semi-private dining room on the second floor. The ramen earned a solid 7/10 from me, but the pork belly dish stole the show—it was divine. Back at the Airbnb, Parth realized he had left his iconic stick water bottle at the restaurant and resigned himself to its loss. Determined to save the day, I quickly hopped on the subway and ran back to retrieve it. Arriving just as the restaurant was closing, I managed to catch the staff and recover the water bottle. Parth was thrilled when I returned, and with my mini side quest complete, I headed to bed, knowing I’d need rest for my early 6 AM flight the next morning.

														The ramen, while satisfying, earned a respectable 7/10, but it was the pork belly dish that truly stood out—it was tender, flavorful, and absolutely divine. As we returned to the Airbnb, content and full, Parth suddenly realized he had left his iconic stick water bottle at the restaurant. Initially, he dismissed it as a lost cause, convinced it was too late to retrieve it. But I wasn’t ready to give up so easily. Determined to save the day, I quickly hopped on the subway and rushed back to the restaurant. The streets were eerily quiet, and by the time I arrived, the restaurant had closed for the night. Fortunately, a few staff members were still inside finishing up, and I was able to explain the situation. They kindly handed over the water bottle, and I felt a rush of relief as I made my way back. When I returned to the Airbnb with the rescued water bottle in hand, Parth’s face lit up with gratitude. It was a small but satisfying victory, a fitting end to an unforgettable trip. With my mini side quest complete, I finally turned in for the night, knowing I’d need every bit of rest for my early 6 AM flight back home.

											The weather forecast had hinted at rain in the early hours, and Paris delivered as promised. Thankfully, it was just a light drizzle, but it was enough to be mildly inconvenient. The real challenge came when the subway station I had planned to use was still closed. This meant I had to walk a little further to the station near the Seine—the same one I had used upon first arriving in Paris. Luckily, my instincts were right, and from there, it was smooth sailing to the airport.

													On my way back, I had a layover in Boston, which turned into a perfect opportunity to catch up with Ungar and get a glimpse into his life at MIT. The day was packed with memorable moments: having a beer at the campus bar, strolling through the iconic MIT grounds, enjoying sandwiches from one of his favorite spots, grabbing tacos at a popular taqueria frequented by both MIT and Harvard students, catching a Red Sox game, and visiting Ungar’s new place. It was a fantastic way to cap off my travels.

Together, we experienced the magic of the Olympics, an event that comes around only once every four years, while immersing ourselves in the charm and history of one of the world’s most celebrated cities. Truly, an unforgettable journey.
