												Our entire family decided to go visit Vincent and Erin in Washington DC. From exploring the Mall to the White House spring gardens tour, we saw all the wonderful sights of 
												our nations capital. This was one of the more recent family trips post Covid and was an opporunity to get out of the pandemic routine. During my time in Washington DC, I was
												also able to meet up with a good number of my high school friends and eat at a ton of Vincent and Erin's favroite restaurants.

											Epic backpacking trip #2! It was hard to contain my excitement walking through the SFO airport terminal. This was an especially rewarding vacation because the week before was likely my busiest week at Eastdil Secured with SF 105. I worked all through Labor Day weekend to get everything in order before I took off. No matter, that was all behind me and I only had new memories to look forward to. First stop, Copenhagen for a 20 hour layover!
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 The plan ride was uneventful. One good thing was that I was able to take my backpacking backpack with me. I watched a few movies, the action scenes from the Hobbit, and 1/5 of Tenant. Even got to sleep for a little! Also, I had great luck and didnâ€™t have someone in the middle seat. The person I was sitting next to had been doing this same flight for the past couple years and knew the flight attendants. He even brought them all chocolates. So kind.

										I landed in Copenhagen airport and rushed my way to customs, just how mom taught me haha! I probably passed by 30-50 people. Turns out the line was super long so I definitely saved almost 30 mins of waiting. The line at customs was disorganized so I made my way to the front best I could. Was listening to a podcast on the Queen of Englandâ€™s passing. So sad. As I made my way through the airport, I noticed tons of Joe & the Juices! I had no idea it was that popular in Denmark. I walked to parking lot #4 to store my large backpacking bag. I almost didnâ€™t find a spot which would have been bad. I decided not to get an international phone plan for Copenhagen so had to take screenshots of where I wanted to go and then compare those to Google maps which shows your location on a map with or without service.
											 </p>
											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I figured out the metro, purchased my ticket, and made my way into the city. While on the train, there was a metro officer checking tickets and someone didnâ€™t have one. He let them off the hook which was nice. The metro was clean and not too busy. On the way over to the city center, I found a walking tour that I was interested and decided my day would be spent visiting all the main tourist attractions. I got to the city center and walked out onto the main road. Wow was it beautiful! The architecture was stunning and reminded me of Boston, MA.

											 A few notable parts of the walking tour: Torvehallerne was a glass building food stall/court that reminded me a lot of the glass food stall/court that Vincent took us to in Spain when we visited him during his study abroad semester. Copenhagen had a ton of Michelin recommended and star restaurants; one of which I went to and will get into later. I saw 3+ wedding ceremonies while on my walking tour. This was likely because it was a Sunday in the summer. Such a great atmosphere. I went to visit Nyhavn which was beautiful! I sat on the side and people watched for a bit before continuing on my tour. Everyone biked everywhere! More bikes than I had ever seen before. Reminded me of a college campus. After Nyhavn, I grabbed a beer from 7-Eleven and drank it by the water. I got a few recommendations from a guy I met named Brady. He suggested I go visit Christiana Freetown. What an experience. I did not stay too long but I was very cool to visit. So many stands selling weed haha. Prob would have been a vibe if I had friends with me but not as much solo. I got to see the Queen of Denmark on her 50th anniversary. There was a ceremony for her. I waited almost an hour to see her; when in Copenhagen right?

												 For dinner, I went to a restaurant called Pluto. This was a recommendation from online and from Brady. They had local Denmark ingredients with Italian and French techniques. I was sitting at the bar and a mom and her son started talking with me. Their names were Ak and Theo. Turns out they were celebrating Theoâ€™s 16th birthday. They traveled to Copenhagen because the drinking age was 16. I bought Theo some birthday chocolate cake to celebrate. The bar tender noticed and gave us a free drink and a birthday shot! What a great dinner night creating a lasting memory. For food, I got ceviche as a starter which came with some of the best bread and butter Iâ€™ve ever had. Then I had an entree with a white fish local to Denmark with a parmesan foam, roasted potatoes, and pickled lettuce. It was so good. I also had a mezcal cocktail and a glass of red wine.

												 After dinner, I walked around and explored more of the city. As I walked around the city center, I noticed that the city social scene was alive and popping. Literally every bar within a 10 block radius was full of locals drinking and gathering together. I was too tired to try my luck at a bar, I also had my backpack on me so didnâ€™t was to wear it while out at a bar. Instead, I decided to sit by a store with free wifi and FaceTime mom. I also checked out the gay district, which was only two streets, but it wasnâ€™t popping either. Because of this, I decided to head to the airport and take a nap before my flight.
												  </p>

													<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													After grabbing my backpack from the airport locker, I learned that airport security was closed until 4am. Because of that, I had to take a nap on the airport floor right outside of security. Not the best sleeping spot in the world but was the most reasonable option. While sleeping, I locked my two bags together and wrapped the handles through my legs so no one could take my stuff. Also, I made friends with a couple traveling from the USA and ended up in the same lounge as me. The lounge was alright. I ate a bit and then headed to my flight for Croatia.

											Landed in Croatia! Woooohooo! I was so excited to meet up with Eric and start exploring the city that would be my travel site for the next twoish weeks. I took the main bus to the city center and was on my way. Everything was pretty well organized which was nice. As I was driving through the city, I noticed there were many different signs labeled Tommy. Turns out Tommy was a supermarket in Croatia. Iâ€™ll have to tell Tommy at Eastdil about this haha. After arriving on my bus, I walked up to Enroute hostel. It was a bit far from old town but I didnâ€™t mind because I could tell that the accommodations were modern and clean. Just what I needed after not having slept for 48 hours.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I checked in and took a quick shower while waiting for Eric. I noticed a poster for deep water soloing! Omg I was pretty set on climbing (didnâ€™t end up doing it which will be on the to-do list for next time). Eric finally arrived at the hostel and we were finally reunited after almost two years! Eric has always been one of my better friends in life that I got along so naturally with. Being able to finally travel with him was such an exciting opportunity/adventure. After catching up for a bit, I wanted to grab a Croatia SIM card. While in the common space, we met a girl named Maybellene. She came with us. We all ended up grabbing lunch at a mom and pop restaurant in Old Town. I got some risotto and calamari plus and Aperol Spritz!

There was Paul from Germany, Sky and Chrissy from the US, and Adam and Sean from the UK. We all started drinking of the hostel and built some solid friendships. We then decided to go drink at the beach and go for a swim before doing an impromptu bar crawl led by Crissy. Some of the group went to grab food. Maybellene, Eric, and I went to grab beer and grab a spot at the beach. We found large 2 L bottles of beer that was so cheap! We grabbed three of them for the group which seemed ridiculous at the time but we deleted them while at the beach.

											The others eventually met us at the beach and we hung out drinking beer and listening to music. Ericâ€™s speaker was such a great move. Paul was talking to us about some great German techno rap music was I was crazy about haha. Need to play it when Iâ€™m home. For the bar hope, we started at Charlieâ€™s bar. I bought drinks for the group and then we all hung out in the alley with everyone else. After that we headed to another bar where I bought Sean an alcoholic beverage I thought he would like and acquired my Croatia beer glass. We all took a picture on the Split Croatia red sign and then headed back to the hostel for bed before our big booze cruise day!

											Booze cruise day!!! What a freaking day this was. It ended up being my favorite day the entire trip not just because of the boat ride but because of the bonding that happened. We got up early around 8:45am for the 9:30am departure. We all woke up a little late so it was a rush to get down to the port and grab breakfast along the way. We made it there exactly at 9:30am but it didnâ€™t matter since the boat was not ready to depart yet. While waiting, we made friends with Kai, Riley, Hyla, and Stella. They were all from the states and ending up becoming very good friends of ours.
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 Eventually, the boat was ready to depart so we all got on. At first, the group started getting worried about the boat cruise and whether or not it was going to be fun. This was because there were families, older folks, and even a dog mixed in with those onboard. However, we were happy with the friends we had onboard and were confident we could have a good time amongst ourselves. On the way to the first stop, the crew brought out white wine and juice. We soon learned that white wine was our only free alcohol option but we didnâ€™t care. Whatever got us drunk! We meet some others: the Italians, a few other Americans, and a few Germans. Everyone was such a great vibe. Things were starting to get more social as the white wine started to flow.

											Our first stop was lunch. The restaurant was situation on a beautiful beach with the bluest water I had seen in Croatia up until that point. So picturesque. While we waited for lunch. I decided to jump in the water and start swimming/snorkeling. It was all so much fun and I convinced Paul and Adam to get in. Unfortunately, Adam stepped on a sea urchin and got spins stuck in his big toe. Even more unfortunate was the boat, restaurant, and bar all did not have tweezers. I had to ask a random local Croatia women if we could borrow hers. It was an interesting interaction because she did not speak English. I used my phone to tell her we would give them back to her Chrissy sprang into first aid mode and tired to help Adam get the spines out of his big toe but to no avail.
