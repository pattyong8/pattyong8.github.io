										After waking up, Eric and I decided to grab some breakfast. Our plan was to do the city walls but it was raining pretty hard. Instead, we got some breakfast at a nearby restaurant. I didnâ€™t realize it but I accidentally ordered all fried foods. Oh well hahah. Eric got some actual breakfast. Then we went back to the hostel to chill and wait out the rain. Eventually, Josh and Tyler made their way back to the hostel as well and boy were they soaked. We all made plans the night before to head to Hvar around 1pm. We just hung out in the hostel until then. I decided to take a nap. Once I woke up, we were ready to go and made our way for the ferry terminal. The guys were nice enough to buy us bus tickets. We shopped by the sandwich shop and the guys got some to-go food before we headed out. I still head leftovers from breakfast so stuck to that.

										We got to the ferry terminals and waiting in line. Josh was telling us about he bee keeping days and how that was his backup plan on college. Once we got on the ferry, I did a few errands before falling asleep like the rest of the crew. We were all pretty tired. Thankfully, Eric had motion sickness pills so none of us got seasick. Eventually, we arrived at our hostel apartment for the night. It was actually super convenient to have our own place which was nice. We got in and started drinking a bit and showered. I killed a few mosquitoes and Eric and I had a competition to see who could kill more. We then went next door to grab some food from a fast food joint called Big Bang Fast Food. Their burgers were huge and fries were nice and crispy. I got the bacon burger which was only 35 kuna. We then ate and pregamed at our apartment. We played a game we made up called bear no bear. Honestly, a funny memory for the books and one we referenced a number of times later that trip. I ask the guys to pick which shirt I should wear. We all went with the shirt with a pocket and made a joke about having chicken nuggets in there haha.

										 Eventually we set out for the town, got a few more beers, and hoped around a few bars. It was popping since it was Friday night. We learned it was the last night for the Carpe Diem Beach Club so Tyler, Eric and I decided to send it. Josh was tired to ended up going home since it wasnâ€™t very much his scene. The entry was 200 kuna which was pretty steep and the drinks we also super expensive. We had many espresso martinis that night. Tyler said we opened his eyes to the magic of the espresso martini. Honestly, the bar made some fire ones. The vibes of the venue were unreal. So cool to attend their last night. We were all just a bit disappointed because the music was below average. I honestly didnâ€™t notice until Tyler and Eric mentioned it and said they wanted to leave. At least we lasted until 3am. Couple memories. Some chick was hitting on Tyler which was funny but wasnâ€™t interested after he told her he was 22. Tyler split a bit of my drink so I gave him mine lol. Our bartender was not happy about making our espresso martinis since they took a ton of effort. Later that night, he performers juggling and a fire performance on stage. On the way back to the hostel, Eric said something silly and I gave him shit for. We worked it out the next morning. Once we got back, we hit the hay and got ready for another great day.

										The next morning we all work up around 11am to start our day. Tyler and Josh were leaving around 5pm so we wanted to hangout with them until they did. Eric decided to stay in bed until the room cleaner came in to kick us out. He pushed it even more by taking a shower hahah. After we all got up, we headed to the local pastry shop for a quick bite. It was the first time I tried the spinach and cheese pastry. I personally thought it was way too cheesy but finished it anyways. Afterwards, Tyler went to go find war drops for water stuck in his ear. I went to go find scuba diving and rock climbing options. Turns out rock climbing was going to be harder than I expected. I was able to find a good scuba diving options though. I also stopped by the local fishing and water gear shop. It was here that I was able to find the cheapest googles I could find.

										 After gathering our supplies, we decided to hit the nearby beach for a beach day. Once we rounded the corner, we noticed that most of the spots by the water were occupied by rocks but there were few other options so we camped out there. I took the first opportunity to hop in the water with the googles and look around. I was mainly focused on looking for sea urchins but was able to admire the wildlife and rock formations as well. After swimming for a bit, I come back to shore and handed Eric the googles. Josh and Eric hopped in for a bit while Tyler stayed ashore. We swam around and hung out. We decided to go check out the yellow banana looking floaty thing and started doing front flips off of it. Another group of guys saw us and decided to join on a nearby floaty. I swam back to get Tyler and convinced him to come out. He swam out to where we were but did not get on the yellow banana thing. Tyler started to head back while Eric and I did a few more flips. It didnâ€™t take long for the owner of the floats to ride over on his jet ski and ask us to get off.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Eric and I swam back to shore and hung out on the rocks with Tyler and Josh. I started to call a few scuba diving shops and eventually settled on one with a refresher course and a day dive. After that, we decided to play Spades for the rest of the day. Itâ€™s a game very similar to hearts but not quite the same. I made a bad play early on but made it up with a series of good round after. Lol I mistaken my hearts as the trump cards because I was used to playing hearts. Tyler was nice enough to let me borrow his sunscreen. After a few rounds, I decided to go for another swim. This time I went further down the coast. I saw so many sea urchins it was kinda unbelievable. So many hazards for locals and tourists. After I came back to shore, I warned a few tourists not to step on the sand. They then asked to borrow the googles which I obliged.

											 We had our fun on the beach and decided it would be best to head back and grab some grub before taking off. We decided on this Italian place by the shore with good reviews. We ordered our food and the guys ran to get their bags from our room. Once the food arrived, Eric and I started to get swarmed by files and wasps. When we ask the waiter about it, he said thatâ€™s going to happen everywhere. I literally had never seen that many files swarm food in my life. There we are least 15 of them. Crazy! It was so hard to fend them off. Eric and I had to constantly swing our arms. Finally the guys got back and we were able to move indoors which helped this situation a ton. I ordered the seafood pizza because I have never had something like that before. Honestly, wasnâ€™t crazy about it.
												</p>

												<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												After dinner, we accompanied the guys to the ferry port and waited around for their ferry to arrive. We are enjoying the moment and reminiscing on our time when a ferry worker came by and informed the guys that the ferry was canceled due to bad weather. He said the only option was a ferry on the opposite side of the island. Josh and Tyler decided to take a chance and booked it for a taxi. I was a bit sad because we were not able to say proper goodbyes so I decided we needed to go see them again in split for one last hurrah. Eric and I went back to the hostel and chilled for a bit. This is when we saw Jack and Chris, two of the guys we met in Dubrovnik on the abandoned hotel activity. We caught up for a moment before they headed out for the night.

										Since I had scuba diving the next morning, I decided I wasnâ€™t going to go out and was going to turn in a bit early. Before then, Eric and I went to go get ice cream and walk around the city. I got tiramisu which was fire. We started to walk towards the back of the Seven club since it was popping off. Turns out that area was popping and had a ton of great restaurants. Although we had already eaten, Eric and I decided to go explore the area and dine at Silk, an Asia restaurant. Honestly, Silk did a fantastic job with their food. I got the pork belly and was actually blown away with how good it was. Honestly, better than some places in the states. I could tell the main chef was a skilled cook. After this, we went back to the hostel and retired from the night. Eric went to go talk to his dad on the roof. I brought Ericâ€™s go pro to video some stuff which was nice of him but I forgot to turn it off after testing it and it ran out of battery the next morning.

										Scuba diving day! I woke up around 7:30am to head to Aqualis Scuba Diving for my refresher course. The 30mins walk over was beautiful. The city was quiet and weather pleasantly warm. Once I got to the dive shop, I was offered coffee and met my instructors Aurelien and Lavinia. Aurelien did my refresher dive and explained all the basics to me again. It was really nice to get this refresher as I did not remember most of the skills I had learned almost 2 years ago. The first dive was a shore dive to review a few of the basics and to make sure I was comfortable underwater. We did a basic skills review and then went to go explore the shore. Unfortunately, the visibility was not as good near the coast due to weather conditions; it was extremely windy that day. I saw a really rare fish called the Ghost Pipe Fish. This fish disguises itself to look like a piece of seaweed. When Aurelien pointed it out, I was confused at first until I saw the fishâ€™s eyes! So cool! The rest of the dive was uneventful but was a great way to get back into the swing of things. Eric let me borrow his GoPro but it was unfortunately out of battery :(. Sad sad. Aurelien was nice enough to try and let me borrow his GoPro shell but it was a different size than Ericâ€™s GoPro.

 										After coming ashore and taking break before the second dive, I got to chat with another regular diver that has dove in many different parts of the world. It was on this day that I learned about live aboard opportunities where you could live on a ship for a week and dive 4+ times a day. I think this is something I will want to try in the future. A few other arrived for the second dive. One of the guys was super attractive and seemed extremely comfortable in the water. I also met another diver named Philipp that was doing his rescue diver course. One the crew got all the gear onboard, we left for the second dive. When we got to the intended dive site, Aurelien deemed the water was too rough to dive in that cove. Because of this, we went to a calmer part of the coast and dove there. The guy I met on the shore said he was getting too sick and did not want to dive. Because of this he stayed out. He was supposed to be my dive buddy but that didnâ€™t matter too much since I just paired up with my divemaster Lavinia.

 										We all got in and started our decent. I had very little trouble equalizing my ears this time which was great! I feel way more confident now with that first part. Just got too slow and steady and continually try and equalize. Once we reached our intended depth, we started exploring. In the part of Croatia we were, our instructor told us that we needed to appreciate the little things since there would be no big fish or sea creatures. That was definitely the case. We saw Moray Eels, a cuttlefish (which was a rare sighting during the day), and a few nudibranchs. It was fun to watch Lavinia touch the nudibranchs and for them to retract. The most impressive thing to me was just floating next to a massive wall drop off in the ocean. So cool! I was learning to control my buoyancy and breathing patterns. Only bad thing was that my scuba googles did not fit perfectly so water kept on seeping in. I did not let that ruin the experience though.

										 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Eventually, we ascended and started heading back. This is when I was talking the most to Philipp about diving around the world and his excursions. So fun to hear and quite inspiring. He was giving me a hard time about not wanting to dive in California because I said it was too cold. When we got back, I got a picture with Lavinia and drank a beer with the local instructors. I spent 3 hours at the shop talking about diving and drank 3+ liters of beers lol. I thought it was free but turns out I had to pay. I didnâ€™t mind though because it was a great experience. A former instructor named Andrej showed up to say hi and dive with the team again. I spent quite a while talking to him about diving and gaining a ton of knowledge on things I did not know about. Honestly, after hanging out with the instructors from Aqualis, I was inspired to become a divemaster. One dayâ€¦ Andrej wrote a book and showed me it.

												Once I finally finished up at the diving shop I headed out. Once again, I did not know I had to pay for the drinks since they kept serving me without me asking. The bartender ran after me to get me to pay the bill lol. I met Eric back at the hostel and was obviously drunk which Eric found funny. He was certain I wouldnâ€™t be able to hang that night since I was already drunk; he was right. After hanging out at the hostel for a bit, we went to get dinner at Central Park Club Hvar. We initially decided to draw it out as long as possible by ordering beers one at a time, then an appetizer, and wrap up with two entrees to share. This is where I discovered their lemon beer which was fantastic. Too bad it was only 2% ABV. After two beers, our friends Jack and Chris found us sitting and decided to join. Was such good company and an excellent way to extend the night further. We were all chatting about Lord of the Rings, going out stories, and acting. We eventually decided to leave. We got confused about the tip so ended up tipping more than we wanted to. Oh well.

													After dinner, Eric and I went back to drop off our bags before heading out again. It was honestly a miracle that I ended up going out again. I was so tired from getting up early and diving but I told myself to at least stay out until midnight since my days in Croatia were coming to an end. We went to Lola Bar to hangout. We ended up sitting with a few other girls, Chris, Jack, and other friends. Eric and I had to share a little small stool seat since people had to be seating in order to be in the area. Eric got a crazy yummy looking mojito with a lime foam in top. So cool to be honest. I finally got too tired and decided to leave. Got back and got ready for bed before passing out.

										Today was our last day in Hvar. We decided we wanted to head to Split in order to catch Josh and Tyler on their last night in Split post booze cruise. Eric and I got breakfast at a local restaurant. We both ordered eggs benedict. Honestly, it was not that great. They used burger buns and didnâ€™t even toast them. I also got fries which were a solid 3/5. Eric got a smoothie that was fire. I considered ordering one but knew I would be too full. After breakfast, we went to go find ferry tickets and waited around for our ferry to arrive. I tired finding another pair of sunglasses I lost which was the second pair I lost on the trip. I couldnâ€™t find them so I grabbed my bags from the hostel and headed to the ferry terminal. Once we got on, we basically napped on the ride to Split. I was so tired tbh.

										Once we arrived in Split, we were pretty worried about the weather. We could see massive black storm clouds in the distance. We hurriedly walked to EnRoute hostel in order to beat the weather. It was actually wild how perfectly we time that since it started to drizzle 30 seconds away from the hostel and then started pouring 5 mins after. If we were carrying out stuff in that weather, we would have gotten soaked to the bone. Actually nuts. Eric was tired and hungover so he wanted to stay at the hostel to take a nap and chill. He also was not feeling the greatest so he wanted to give his body a chance to recover. I took this time to check out a well regarded restaurant in Split called Villa Spiza. I went at 4pm so was seated immediately but there was still only limited seating at that time. The interior was old and rustic, keeping with the original architecture of Old Town Split. This place seemed very popular. Holy was the food amazing. The kitchen was run by two local Croatia females that were cooking up a storm. I was actually so torn on what to get. I ended up choosing the classic lamb pea stew. It was cooked in a red wine base sauce with many different herbs. I honestly was blown away by the flavor and want to try and make it in SF.

										After dining at Villa Spiza, I started walking to one of the deep water soloing areas. On the way, I passed by a beer shop and grabbed a local Croatian brewed pale ale. It was extremely refreshing and much happier than expected. I had strangers snap a few photos of me along the way. On the walk over, I noticed I was passing by a number of plaques to honor the olympic champions of Croatia many of these were water polo. It reminded me that I missed the Croatia water polo finals by one day. It was in Split! Oh well bad luck. I continued my walk to the deep water solo cliffs. Honestly, seemed a bit sketchier than I anticipated and once you feel, the ladder to get back to land which not close by any means. This area was actually situated next to an outdoor aquatic center which was cool to check out. I have to take a second to point out again how much I love the ladders that lead into the ocean. Yes, I know they come from necessity but I still want to give credit to their aesthetic nature.

										 On my way back, I also walked through the underground caverns of Old Town split. Super cool. I tried to stop by the booze cruise company and ask if they would give me 100 Kuna back for the snorkels I forgot to return. They did not give it back. I also tried stopping by an adventure company to see if there were any kayak rentals available but it did not work out. I knew it was going to be hard to acquire rentals the next day but decided we could figure it out the day of. Also, rentals were ridiculously expensive at 50 euros for the day. I tried taking local streets back to the hostel but kinda got lost. I somehow ended up at the maritime museum and then the top of the shopping center I was at. I came at the right time to witness the gym and martial arts studio in full swing. I thought this mall was abandoned!

											When I got back, I got to meet up with Tyler and ask about the booze cruise. Turns out it was not the same experience as ours but was a ton of fun regardless. Josh went to take a nap because he was exhausted and drunk haha. We caught up for a bit and then meet another friends named Alec. The three of them went to go get food. I had already eaten so I stayed at the hostel, showered, and tried to make new friends. At that point my social battery was pretty drained but I went and sat with a new group of people and tired to meet them. It was then that Tyler, Eric, and Alec got back with their food so I went to go sit and hangout with them as they ate. We sat in the kitchen at the same table as a few German girls that weâ€™re taking a gap year after high school. They were quite shy so we didnâ€™t get to socialize with them much. Eventually, Josh got up and we all freaked out when he got to the room. I offered him white wine and he gaged haha.

											 We decided to try and go walk around the town, get ice cream, and some pastries! Josh, Eric, Tyler, and I had this running joke about wanting a pastry all the time. Joshâ€™s go to was the spinach and cheese Burek. I loved the potato Burek. We all got ice cream from a shop on the main strip of Old Town and then walked to the Old Town center to listen to music and chat. After we finished our food and ice cream, we walked back to Enroute to catch some rest. I hangout with Josh and Tyler in the common room for a bit before turning in. Katarina, one of the hostel workers, had the night shift that week so I was able to say hi and catch her up on my travels. One fun memory was that Josh and Tyler admitted to picking up on me and Ericâ€™s slang/banter towards one another. Aka we said broooooo, okay, were super sarcastic, and said do you wanna fight all the time haha. Our group of four made a really good squad and was a large part of the positivity in the last couple days of the trip. Tyler and Josh were just great vibes.

										Josh, Tyler, and I were sad because this was our last full day in Croatia. They actually made it a point to extend their time in split as much as possible so we could have one last full day together. I honestly wouldnâ€™t have wanted to do it with any other crew. These two felt like a natural extension of me and Eric. All good things have to come to an end. We got up and went to grab food at the Tommyâ€™s around the corner. I got a Mexican chicken burek and a sweet vanilla donut equivalent. Was so tasty but stuck in my gut. As we were eating our pastries outside. I saw Jack walking by across the street. What great timing! I went in the hostel with him to drop off his stuff and accompany him back to the group. We were intending to meet up with Alec as well but none of us had a means of communicating with him. We then headed downtown to the beach area. On the way, we saw this tiny funny looking car. It was a one seater and the driver had to slouch over. When we got to Plaza Bacvice, we tired walking around the corner to rent kayaks but then vendor that used to exist there was shut down. Locals said it was because the owner did not have permits to operate there.
										 </p>

										 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
 										We then walked to the other side of the water and I went to go check out the deep water soloing. I scrambled over rocks and walked around 5mins to get to the soloing. Honestly, conditions were fine but the entry and exit out of the water did not look easy. I was also certain that the water was populated with sea urchin that would be hard to avoid. We decided to audible and head to Znjan beach instead. This was 100% the right call. This was the first time I attempted to call an Uber in Croatia. The drive did something smart. He accepted our trip and then when he got closer, he canceled the trip and then found us and drove us to our intended destination anyways. Smart on him and we still paid him the agreed upon 66 Kuna to get there. Great deal to be honest and saved us an hour of walking time. On the drive over, our driver told us we made the right decision because the beach that we were previously at was next to a night club and that patrons would usually pee into the pool upon exiting the club. Funny because I swam in this water the first couple days I was there. Oh well, pee is sterile anyways haha.

										 Znjan beach was significantly better, the beach was still rocky but white and large. Plenty of room to lounge around compared to the other beach. It was also next to a few day clubs which was nice since we got to listen to the day club music and vibe without having to pay the cover to get in. We put our stuff down on the beach and I immediately dove in. The water was so nice and refreshing. Thankfully, we had three pairs of googles/snorkeling masks so we were able to get in and look around in small groups. I didnâ€™t see very many sea urchins in shallow water which was nice for a change. After getting out of the water for a bit and soaking in the hot sun. Eric had a good idea to find a nearby grocery store and grab a few 2L bottles of beers to drink. Jack and I accompanied them and went to the Tommyâ€™s not more than a 5min walk away. We each grabbed a 2L bottle and some chips. Eric was insistent on us getting paper green soccer cups. They were literally child birthday cups haha. Then we headed back to the guys to drinks and enjoy the sun.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Tyler had the great idea of playing poker as our drinking game. We each started with 20 rocks and could use 10 rocks to make someone drink. If you finished your beer, you could get 3 more rocks. We played for a bit, I went down at first but then turned the tables around with a straight and had the most rocks out of all our friends. I gave some to Josh because he ran out. We decided to take a swim break. I was able to get in, stay underwater stealthily, and scare Josh by touching his leg underwater. I told Tyler and Jack I would be able to do it and success! Josh admitted to being freaked out for a bit. So fun. I then swam to the nearby peer to check out the fish/rocks. There were many more fish on this side. They were, however, still tiny. On the other side of the pier was a scuba diving shore dive site. I was able to talk to some of the divers about what they were offering which was fun. I then swam under the bridge and through a few schools of fish before swimming back to my friends. Twas a fun mini adventure. We kept playing poker for a bit before deciding to head back to the hostel and freshening up before grabbing dinner and going out for the night. Unfortunately, Josh and Tyler were heading out at 7pm to head to Zagreb.

											 On our way back. I tried convincing Eric to jump on a bounce house with me. We didnâ€™t notice the owner was nearby and he got pissed at us for even thinking about getting on. Kinda unnecessary on his part but I get it. Iâ€™m sure drunk tourists bother him all the time. When we got back to the group, they were talking to one of the attendees at the private beach club party that was next to us. He convinced us that if we left a good review for him online, he would get 50 euros for each 5 star review. We didnâ€™t know him well though so did not end up doing it. Maybe next time! Eric called an Uber and we all headed back. We all showered and then got ready to go some dinner. We ended up meeting up with Alec when we arrived back which was nice. We all hangout in the common room for a bit and talked about our awesome day. Since Tyler still had a full bottle of vodka, we all took a goodbye shot to celebrate our friendship and adventures together.

												I had a plan to take us to a nice restaurant in Old Town that served traditional Njoki with braised beef but the restaurant did not open until 6pm and when we arrived they said they needed another 10-15mins. This was cutting it too close for Josh and Tyler so we walked to the bus terminal and they got take out instead. On the way there, we made sure to get a picture on the Split sign for the memory book. Once they got their food we said our goodbyes are head our separate ways. Honestly, I was sad saying by to them. Like I said before, they were some of the best friends we made in Croatia and we were such a good travel squad. Hope to see them both in the states and canâ€™t wait for our next adventure.

												 The rest of us went to grab food. I initially tried going back to the restaurants with Njoki but it was so not the vibe. No one was there and the prices were more expensive than I thought they would be. Because of this, I went to join the others are a pizza bar called Basta right next to the ocean. It was such a vibe and my pizza was fire. Eric got a pizza where he had side rack of prosciutto. We should have gotten that one! Afterwards, we walked to Old Town and crashed a hostel event at Booze and Snooze. Jack was in the group chat since he had previously stayed here. They were playing a hardcore version of Kings Cup where each card signified a more touchy/emotional action. One of the cards was assumptions and I got targeted for being Asian lol. Donâ€™t care but it was funny how everyone felt that comfortable calling out strangers. I guess everyone was drunk so makes sense. We then headed to Charlieâ€™s bar as a group. I honestly was tired going in but it was worth staying because we got a table inside so I was able to sit. On top of that, they were playing bangers/sing alongs so it was such a great vibe. I was reenergized for sure. Funny memory was that there were these Canadian girls that I become great friends with and were asking me about night party plans. I think it might have been because I told them I was gay haha.

											 We then headed to a club that the staff at Booze and Snooze had connections at. Because of this, we all got in for free and didnâ€™t have to pay a 100 Kuna cover. Jack was not feeling it but I convinced him that we should at least walk in and check it out to take advantage of the free cover. It was a cool club not I had been to better one this trip so I was cool leaving. We all went to grab pizza instead near the bus terminal. This was my second time this trip eating at this pizza shop. Honestly, much better than last time but I think it is because they threw it in the oven for a bit. We then went back and retired for the night. I was telling Eric how I was sad about leaving and he response was for me to quit. Lol Eric will never stop trying to convince me. I said my final by to Katarina and then headed to bed

										Last few hours in Croatia. I woke up around 10:30am and started to pack. I wanted to leave for the airport on the 12pm bus so I had to get going. Was originally going to head to the airport with Alec but timing didnâ€™t work out. Instead, I walked down to the bus terminal with Eric. We stopped for a pastry one last time. I got, you guessed it, a potato Burek. So yummy but also made me feel sick for a bit. This diet was catching up to me. Once we got to the bus terminal, Eric and I said our final goodbyes and then I headed for the bus terminal. Traveling with Eric was just as fun, easy, and adventurous as I thought it would be. We bonded so well that summer in Seattle and I knew from then on I had met one of my best friends in life. We 100% made up for the Asia post college trip with this trip. Best trip potentially of my life thus far.

 										Once I got to the bus stop. I was told by the bus driver that I needed to grab a bus ticket at the window. I went and they told me they were out of 12pm tickets. I was worried I was not going to make it to the airport in time but had no other choice than to buy the 12:40pm ticket. As I was about to give up, I saw some others asking the bus driver if they could get on even though it was full. He allowed it so I tried my luck and was able to get on. I had to stand the entire bus ride but was better than potentially missing my flight/other issues. There was plenty of time to reminisce on my time in Croatia. I was sad to leave but also so happy that I had the time I did. So many amazing experiences to add to the memory book.

											Once I got to the airport, they made me check my bag which sucked. I am pretty sure I did not need to but I wasnâ€™t going to argue with the airpot terminal worker. It was alright because I was able to pick it up in Copenhagen. I waited at the terminal before boarding my flight. The flight was uneventful so will skip that. When I landed in Copenhagen, I was worried about customs and how long that would take. I rushed to customs but was pleasantly surprised when they line was only 30 seconds. Amazing! Because I had already navigated the Copenhagen airport once before, I already knew where to go and headed straight for the metro. I also knew how the metro worked this time so was able to navigate to my hostel with little issues.

											I decided to stay at Next House which felt more like a hotel than a hostel. There was a beautiful lobby, tons of common space, a gym, soccer court, game room, and 3 restaurants. I am pretty sure the complex had over 300 rooms. I checked in and went directly to my room to settle in. I dropped off my stuff and chatted with one of my roommates that was doing his masters in Copenhagen, he was still trying to find housing. Turns out he was Canadian and was super friendly. He was going on a Tinder date so I wished him luck and went to the lobby. This lobby gave a free welcome beer which was super nice. I grabbed mine walked around a bit and then sat in a chair to FaceTime my mom for a bit. 5 minutes into the conversation, I see a curly black haired girl looking at me that looked oddly familiar. In that instant, I realized it was Stella and Hyla! OMG! What are the freaking odds. I had last seen them in Dubrovnik. Like the world is so freaking small and this was the perfect example. I didnâ€™t even know they were going to Copenhagen. Wow. So stunned. We greeted each other like old friends and decided to grab dinner together. We attributed this good luck to the universe signaling we were to be good friends. I immediately messaged all our friends from Croatia and we all freaked out together. Eric had to be freaked out 3 times in 3 separate group chats haha.

													 We decided to walk around the Meat Packing district and find a place to eat. I remember researching this area and learned it had some great restaurants so I was very excited. We ended up going to a local spot called Chicky Grill Bar that served a number of local Copenhagen classics. Because it was my last night, I decided to order two dishes to try as much of the Danish cuisine as possible. I got a fired fish dish and a pork dish. The Pork skin was divine. So crispy and the pork was perfectly cooked. The gravy was to die for. I was not as crazy about the fish dish since they used way too much mayo but I still ate as much fish as I could. Funny memory was watching Hyla accidentally flinging some of the crispy pork skin across the table into a plant pot. We literally couldnâ€™t stop laughing it was so funny. After this, we went to celebrate my last night in Europe at War Dogs with a pitcher of beer. The pitcher was a bit pricy but whatever, when in Rome. We talked about how Hyla and Stella met, my skiing aspirations, dating, friends, traveling, amongst other topics. We were all tired so we walked back and turned in for the night. Last night in Europe was a success! So glad I bumped into these two as it really made for a perfect way to close out the trip. These two were some of my great friends during this trip. So happy to have met them and canâ€™t wait to see them in the states! The plan ride back was uneventful. Only fun fact to call out was that on both of the longer legs of the trip, I did not have someone in the middle seat. My strategy worked muahahaha! I rewatched the Dark Knight Rises. I forgot how amazing it was. So good.

														This was 100% a top 3 trip in my life up to this point if not the best trip thus far. If I had to sum it up in three points it would be as follows: 1) The trip was the definition of spontaneous. Eric and I were able to do what we wanted, whenever we wanted, and however we wanted. It was so freeing. 2) We met some of the best people I have met in my life. Everyone was so down to earth and full of adventure. It made ever activity that much more fun. 3) The Hostel culture/atmosphere was unreal. Each place was so welcoming and provided the perfect opportunity to meet others. Best hostels were Enroute hostel for its common space and hostel Angelina for itâ€™s activities. A bonus reason, and likely understated one was my travel buddy Eric, without such an easygoing, adventurous partners, the trip would have been so much less fun. Eric and I just vibe together so well which only enhanced the overall experience. As it stands now, this has been one of my lifetime highlights. Canâ€™t wait for the next adventure!
