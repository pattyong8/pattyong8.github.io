												This was a top three trip of all time if not the best trip I have ever done up until this point. I met
												some truly amazing people, adventured without bounds, and experienced life like I have never before.
												This was the trip that convinced me that I must go hostel hoping in a foreign country at least once a year in my youth.
												Eric and I reconnecting as old best buds from our Seattle internship and experienced some of the most exciting parts of Croatia.
												Some highlights include the booze cruise with enroute friends, scuba diving in Hvar, and the Dubrovnik Old
												Town swimming spot.

											Epic backpacking trip #2! It was hard to contain my excitement walking through the SFO airport terminal. This was an especially rewarding vacation because the week before was likely my busiest week at Eastdil Secured with SF 105. I worked all through Labor Day weekend to get everything in order before I took off. No matter, that was all behind me and I only had new memories to look forward to. First stop, Copenhagen for a 20 hour layover!
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 The plan ride was uneventful. One good thing was that I was able to take my backpacking backpack with me. I watched a few movies, the action scenes from the Hobbit, and 1/5 of Tenant. Even got to sleep for a little! Also, I had great luck and didn’t have someone in the middle seat. The person I was sitting next to had been doing this same flight for the past couple years and knew the flight attendants. He even brought them all chocolates. So kind.

										I landed in Copenhagen airport and rushed my way to customs, just how mom taught me haha! I probably passed by 30-50 people. Turns out the line was super long so I definitely saved almost 30 mins of waiting. The line at customs was disorganized so I made my way to the front best I could. Was listening to a podcast on the Queen of England’s passing. So sad. As I made my way through the airport, I noticed tons of Joe & the Juices! I had no idea it was that popular in Denmark. I walked to parking lot #4 to store my large backpacking bag. I almost didn’t find a spot which would have been bad. I decided not to get an international phone plan for Copenhagen so had to take screenshots of where I wanted to go and then compare those to Google maps which shows your location on a map with or without service.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I figured out the metro, purchased my ticket, and made my way into the city. While on the train, there was a metro officer checking tickets and someone didn’t have one. He let them off the hook which was nice. The metro was clean and not too busy. On the way over to the city center, I found a walking tour that I was interested and decided my day would be spent visiting all the main tourist attractions. I got to the city center and walked out onto the main road. Wow was it beautiful! The architecture was stunning and reminded me of Boston, MA.

											 A few notable parts of the walking tour: Torvehallerne was a glass building food stall/court that reminded me a lot of the glass food stall/court that Vincent took us to in Spain when we visited him during his study abroad semester. Copenhagen had a ton of Michelin recommended and star restaurants; one of which I went to and will get into later. I saw 3+ wedding ceremonies while on my walking tour. This was likely because it was a Sunday in the summer. Such a great atmosphere. I went to visit Nyhavn which was beautiful! I sat on the side and people watched for a bit before continuing on my tour. Everyone biked everywhere! More bikes than I had ever seen before. Reminded me of a college campus. After Nyhavn, I grabbed a beer from 7-Eleven and drank it by the water. I got a few recommendations from a guy I met named Brady. He suggested I go visit Christiana Freetown. What an experience. I did not stay too long but I was very cool to visit. So many stands selling weed haha. Prob would have been a vibe if I had friends with me but not as much solo. I got to see the Queen of Denmark on her 50th anniversary. There was a ceremony for her. I waited almost an hour to see her; when in Copenhagen right?

												 For dinner, I went to a restaurant called Pluto. This was a recommendation from online and from Brady. They had local Denmark ingredients with Italian and French techniques. I was sitting at the bar and a mom and her son started talking with me. Their names were Ak and Theo. Turns out they were celebrating Theo’s 16th birthday. They traveled to Copenhagen because the drinking age was 16. I bought Theo some birthday chocolate cake to celebrate. The bar tender noticed and gave us a free drink and a birthday shot! What a great dinner night creating a lasting memory. For food, I got ceviche as a starter which came with some of the best bread and butter I’ve ever had. Then I had an entree with a white fish local to Denmark with a parmesan foam, roasted potatoes, and pickled lettuce. It was so good. I also had a mezcal cocktail and a glass of red wine.

												 After dinner, I walked around and explored more of the city. As I walked around the city center, I noticed that the city social scene was alive and popping. Literally every bar within a 10 block radius was full of locals drinking and gathering together. I was too tired to try my luck at a bar, I also had my backpack on me so didn’t was to wear it while out at a bar. Instead, I decided to sit by a store with free wifi and FaceTime mom. I also checked out the gay district, which was only two streets, but it wasn’t popping either. Because of this, I decided to head to the airport and take a nap before my flight.
												  </p>

													<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													After grabbing my backpack from the airport locker, I learned that airport security was closed until 4am. Because of that, I had to take a nap on the airport floor right outside of security. Not the best sleeping spot in the world but was the most reasonable option. While sleeping, I locked my two bags together and wrapped the handles through my legs so no one could take my stuff. Also, I made friends with a couple traveling from the USA and ended up in the same lounge as me. The lounge was alright. I ate a bit and then headed to my flight for Croatia.

											Landed in Croatia! Woooohooo! I was so excited to meet up with Eric and start exploring the city that would be my travel site for the next twoish weeks. I took the main bus to the city center and was on my way. Everything was pretty well organized which was nice. As I was driving through the city, I noticed there were many different signs labeled Tommy. Turns out Tommy was a supermarket in Croatia. I’ll have to tell Tommy at Eastdil about this haha. After arriving on my bus, I walked up to Enroute hostel. It was a bit far from old town but I didn’t mind because I could tell that the accommodations were modern and clean. Just what I needed after not having slept for 48 hours.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I checked in and took a quick shower while waiting for Eric. I noticed a poster for deep water soloing! Omg I was pretty set on climbing (didn’t end up doing it which will be on the to-do list for next time). Eric finally arrived at the hostel and we were finally reunited after almost two years! Eric has always been one of my better friends in life that I got along so naturally with. Being able to finally travel with him was such an exciting opportunity/adventure. After catching up for a bit, I wanted to grab a Croatia SIM card. While in the common space, we met a girl named Maybellene. She came with us. We all ended up grabbing lunch at a mom and pop restaurant in Old Town. I got some risotto and calamari plus and Aperol Spritz!

											After lunch, we walked back to the hostel and decided to sign up for the booze cruise advertised at the hostel. Eric and I started meeting some folks in the common area and convinced a ton of people to go on the booze cruise with us. Those folks ended up becoming some of our best friends during the trip. There was Paul from Germany, Sky and Chrissy from the US, and Adam and Sean from the UK. We all started drinking of the hostel and built some solid friendships. We then decided to go drink at the beach and go for a swim before doing an impromptu bar crawl led by Crissy. Some of the group went to grab food. Maybellene, Eric, and I went to grab beer and grab a spot at the beach. We found large 2 L bottles of beer that was so cheap! We grabbed three of them for the group which seemed ridiculous at the time but we deleted them while at the beach.

											The others eventually met us at the beach and we hung out drinking beer and listening to music. Eric’s speaker was such a great move. Paul was talking to us about some great German techno rap music was I was crazy about haha. Need to play it when I’m home. For the bar hope, we started at Charlie’s bar. I bought drinks for the group and then we all hung out in the alley with everyone else. After that we headed to another bar where I bought Sean an alcoholic beverage I thought he would like and acquired my Croatia beer glass. We all took a picture on the Split Croatia red sign and then headed back to the hostel for bed before our big booze cruise day!

											Booze cruise day!!! What a freaking day this was. It ended up being my favorite day the entire trip not just because of the boat ride but because of the bonding that happened. We got up early around 8:45am for the 9:30am departure. We all woke up a little late so it was a rush to get down to the port and grab breakfast along the way. We made it there exactly at 9:30am but it didn’t matter since the boat was not ready to depart yet. While waiting, we made friends with Kai, Riley, Hyla, and Stella. They were all from the states and ending up becoming very good friends of ours.
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 Eventually, the boat was ready to depart so we all got on. At first, the group started getting worried about the boat cruise and whether or not it was going to be fun. This was because there were families, older folks, and even a dog mixed in with those onboard. However, we were happy with the friends we had onboard and were confident we could have a good time amongst ourselves. On the way to the first stop, the crew brought out white wine and juice. We soon learned that white wine was our only free alcohol option but we didn’t care. Whatever got us drunk! We meet some others: the Italians, a few other Americans, and a few Germans. Everyone was such a great vibe. Things were starting to get more social as the white wine started to flow.

											Our first stop was lunch. The restaurant was situation on a beautiful beach with the bluest water I had seen in Croatia up until that point. So picturesque. While we waited for lunch. I decided to jump in the water and start swimming/snorkeling. It was all so much fun and I convinced Paul and Adam to get in. Unfortunately, Adam stepped on a sea urchin and got spins stuck in his big toe. Even more unfortunate was the boat, restaurant, and bar all did not have tweezers. I had to ask a random local Croatia women if we could borrow hers. It was an interesting interaction because she did not speak English. I used my phone to tell her we would give them back to her Chrissy sprang into first aid mode and tired to help Adam get the spines out of his big toe but to no avail.

												Our second stop was the Blue Lagoon. I was the only one that got a snorkel before they ran out so I let the group switch off using it. I was so excited once we stopped that I told Paul I wanted to be the first ones to jump off the boat and made a bee line for the top. We ended up jumping and it was loads of fun! We even got our entire group to jump at one point and got it on film. One of my favorite memories of the trip. At one point, there was a couple that looks like they were being pulled away by the current so I swam out to them to see if they needed help. They said they were fine. There was a larger German man that was trying to get up the ladder but was having trouble. His group of friends were all laughing which seemed mean but he was laughing to so I guess his weight was a running joke with his group of friends.
	They all blew up the slide at the second stop. I went down it once, head first but it wasn’t that cool. Afterwards, Sky, Paul, and I had a pull up competition on the water slide handles. Paul and I tied at 11 while Sky got 7. Was fun to do this competition since Sky is a climbing and Paul is into calisthenics. Good to know I could compete! Eric posted a pic of all of us to get a free beer. Woot woot.

 											Then we set off for our last stop, the shipwreck. I used the snorkeling gear to dive down and explore the ship wreck. At one point, I went through the haul of the ship and dove through it. Exhilarating! The water was so salty so I stoped snorkeling. Sky and I made it our goal to climb the boat in whatever way possible besides the ladder. At one point, we were climbing on a few extremities of the boat and everyone was watching us. We made that boat our bouldering wall for the day. I got random scratches throughout the day which was hilarious. Thankfully, I have my tetanus shot. We got a ton of sunset picture with the group. I had a few good conversions with Kai about his life and his own travels. Everyone in our group was amazing and so much fun to be around. Memories for a life time.

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Speaking of memories, this is where my memory started to drift a bit. We got back onto shore and I apparently carried 4 cups of white wine with me before heading out. Typically me haha. I kept trying to convince people I only drank 3 cups of wine. No one believed me haha. We then headed back to the hostel where I showered and passed out for two ours. Once I woke up, people had already eaten and been just hanging around the hostel. I decided to go out and stay up with Sky and Paul until their 5 am bus. I tried to rally Eric but he was sleepy. Chrissy came with us. Unfortunately, she has a blister on her toe. Ouch. We stopped by a Mexican restaurant for burritos, not my favorite. No rice or beans. Then we went downtown.

												 Chrissy was tired so she headed back. I just ended up chatting and hanging out with Sky and Paul until they needed to leave. We got pizza near the bus terminal. Then we saw a building labeled “Auotmatic Klub”. We thought it was a bar or club but turns out it was a casino. We left pretty quickly because it stank of cigarettes. Ewww. Then we headed back to the hostel where I said my final goodbyes to Paul and Sky. They were def some of my favorite people I have ever met while traveling so I was sad to see them go. Until next time.

											We got up late and decided it was time to head to Dubrovnik. I didn’t want to take a bus because I wanted to make stops along the way and drive by the coast. I convinced Eric and Chrissy to split a car rental with me. It came out to less than $50 per person. We started the day by grabbing breakfast at a shop near old town. There was an international chef that cooked a mean scrambled egg. So delicate and delicious. We sat and booked our car rental. Next we started walking to the enterprise rental car shop to pick up the car. I used my credit card because I received free insurance with rental cars through Chase. We drove back to the hostel to collect our things and then we’re off. We headed for Omis and looked around a bit before heading off. I saw some rock climbers while I was there. The rock looked so solid. I wish I could have stayed and climbed. Chrissy wanted to quickly make our way to Dubrovnik so we headed there without stopped very much.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The drive by the ocean was gorgeous. It was hard for me to take my eyes off of the ocean. I got to chat with Eric for a bit while we drove. Was nice to catch up with an old friend. We decided to stop for food so picked a random town named Podgora and ate by the water. It was so nice. Funny memory was that we initially drove our car down to the pedestrian street by accident. It was kinda fun but also embarrassing. We instead parked our car by a nearby hotel and made our way down. I was interested in swimming but timing did not work out. After eating our burgers, a number of wasps wouldn’t leave us alone. Some of the locals were watching me as I was freaking out and put my plate on another table. Also, the food was amazing. The burger patty had a ton of fat but was exactly what we were craving. There were so many cats on this island. They were unbelievably cute!

											 We headed back to the car, Chrissy wanted to take the front seat since she was feeling car sick. On the way to the bridge that connected Croatia via car, we drove by a number of fruit shops. One of them was owned by an older Croatia man that built a fountain to display his watermelons. We just had to stop and explore it! Eric got some fruit and Chrissy got a home brewed alcoholic beverage. So cool! We drove on the road until we came to an impasse at the bridge. It was interesting because none of the maps picked up on the detour. We literally had to retrace our steps multiple times before we found the detour. It took us through an out of the way cute town with a beautiful castle. I would have never stopped here on my own otherwise so was nice to see. Eventually, we came up on Dubrovnik and got gas along the way. Turns out parking in the city was around $100 a day so we chose to drop off the car at the enterprise rental shop. Eric came with me and we hung out on the way back. We went to the hostel and put our bags away. While here, I met Josh for the first time. He seemed really cool and smart. Told him we would try and hangout tomorrow and was looking forward to meeting his other friend Tyler.

											 Eric and I then left to explore the city for a bit. We were tired so we didn’t go out for drinks. We were hungry so we got a few pastries. This was the first time I had a Burek and omg was it freaking amazing. So freaking yummy. I was literally blown away haha. The city was breathtaking. Holy smokes. I didn’t know until I arrived in Croatia but this city was the model for Kings Landing in Game of Thrones. The entire city was ancient and the architecture was stunning. Eric and I wondered until we got outside the walls near the port and then got a chance to finally have a deep catchup conversation. I was able to hear all about his life and share the important parts of mine. We reflected on a number of things: work, travel, life, goals, salaries, love life, aspirations, etc. It was a much needed conversation and reminded me why I enjoyed Eric’s company so much. After a few hours of chatting, we retired to our hostel and turned in for the night. This conversation really made me rethink a couple things in life and reflect on whether I was on the right path or not. Trips like these keep me grounded on my priorities and what I want out of life.

											We woke up later and decided to check out the city the others went on a walking tour of the city which seemed cool but Eric and I wanted to just explore randomly. Of course, our first stop was the pastry shop named Mlinar. I got another beef Burek that nearly blew my socks off again. We then strolled around to check out the city. It was even more beautiful during the day. We explore outside the city walls and asked around for kayak and jet ski rentals. Neither seemed very interesting so we went to explore the swimming spot outside the city walls instead. Wow this spot was so picturesque. We grabbed some beers and went to hangout. I decided I wanted to cliff jump so went first and started a trend because everyone else in the area then started to jump as well. Eric and I did a jump together which I got on film. I also brought out my camera into the water and videos Eric and I have a blast. So worth.

										 While swimming around I noticed a good amount of sea urchins in the water and was now super careful because of what happened to Adam. Someone had snorkeling googles which was awesome and was nice enough to let us borrow them. It was even more beautiful underwater. There were tons of small fish and marine life. Eric used them also and looked underwater which was fun. Eric got a video of me showering at the swim spot which I thought looked fire. One really cool thing about Croatia is that there are tons of ladders everywhere that lead into the ocean, this is because there were many swimming spots that did not have sandy beaches. Instead you jumped into the ocean off of rocks and climbed out using the ladder.

											 After we had our fun at the swimming spot, we walked back to the hostel. This is when I learned this was Dubrovnik’s museums 150th anniversary. So many years of history! On our way back, I stopped by a church to look instead. Eric kinda just wondered off so I just met him back at the hostel. We hung out for a bit before grabbing drinks and food with Stella and Hyla and heading to the hostel for the abandoned hotel activity + night swimming. We all got kabobs and beers then headed to the hostel to meet new friends. We ate on top of the hostel and met a ton of new people. As we were leaving, we bummed into Josh again and met Tyler for the first time. Little did I know that we would become such amazing friends and travel much of Croatia together.

											 On our walk to the abandoned hotel, I mostly hung out with Josh and got to learn and about his life and interests. Good bonding conversation for sure. We actually started leading the entire group even though we had no idea where we were going haha. This was even more funny because we initially lost our hostel guide upon leaving grab beverage store. Tyler and I also got some time to chat and bonded over food and food blogs. Once we got to the abandoned hotel, we found Josh taking a time lapse and gathered everyone for a group photo. Eric walked on this own down to the beach. I explored the rest of the abandoned hotel with our new friends. Met a few folks and then reconvened with Josh, Tyler, and Eric. While we were in the abandoned hotel, we started to get lost which was scary since it was getting dark. One of the Americans we were with tried scaring people which was not very cool.

												We eventually found our way out and we’re about to leave before I realized Eric and Josh were still in the abandoned hotel. Turns out they were not lost, they just went higher than us and took their time coming down. Good for them because I was kinda scared when I got lost haha. We all made our way down to the beach and went for a night swim. We finished our last beers in the water and chatted about life. It started to get cold so we exited the water and started to put our clothes on. The owner of the restaurant on the beach came up to talk to us and told us to take our trash with us. I tired having a conversation with him but there was a clear language barrier.

									 We then started our walk back. Some of us were pretty keen on Red Bull Vodkas. I was about to buy a handle but knew I would get paid back so decided against it. We went back to our satellite hostel instead so wouldn’t have had enough people to drink with anyways. We played a few card games with our new friends and pregames a bit. It was all fun and games until a local Croatia land came by and told us to keep it down. That was our cue to leave and hit an Irish bar everyone was going to. Once we got there, I decided not to buy a beer and instead walk with Josh to the nearby grocery store to get cheaper canned beers. This was definitely the move. After a bit, everyone decided they wanted to hit the club so we went at midnight before they started charging a cover.

											The club was a ton of fun and there was great music. Also, the venue itself was beautiful! It was situation inside of an Old Town stone building. The lights and acoustics were unrealistic. I got drinks for Stella, Hyla, and Eric. Boy were they expensive. It’s okay though cus Eric got me a few beers. Funny moment was when a group of bachelors were holding flashing iPhone signs above their heads saying they were single. Too funny. Eric kept on bringing me beers when I wanted to leave. He’s too good of a friend. Josh, Stella, and Hyla left a bit early. Tyler and I left a few hours after. Eric was vibing so he stayed pretty late and then hung out with a family of cats. I got a pasty on the way back. Was the first time I got the potato roll and it hit different drunk coming from the club. Was planning on getting many more of those. Eric and I were lucky to get the hostel room to ourselves that night. Was preferable because it was small and we came back drunk drunk from the club. Twas a great night for partying.

									 This was our last full day in Dubrovnik. Eric and I started the day by going to a food shop outside the city that served civapi. This was the first time I had this dish and it was amazing. Eric and I were stunned when we got it because they used so many sausages. It was actually so yummy but was a bit saucy. I also got sunglasses from a nearby shop for 55 kuna. Eric and I went to the Hilton across from the food shop to eat our food. The terrace was conformable and they had a nice view of the city walls. Eric wasn’t feeling the best and said he needed a rest day. Because of this, I decided to meet up with Tyler and Josh to go explore the island of Lokrum. At first I was not that interested because it cost 200 kuna but decided it would be worth it. It was supposed to rain that day but thankfully it didn’t too hard.
										</p>

										<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
										We decided to try and make the 2pm ferry but just barley missed it. Literally by 30 seconds. It was funny because Josh was saying this would totally happen to us the entire way to the port. No matter, it gave us the opportunity to check out the swimming spot Eric and I hung out at the day before. It was a lot windier that day so the waves were quite rough. It was so harsh that the walk way to the swim spot would occasionally be overrun by waves. It made it tricky to get over but not impossible. Josh and Tyler wanted to record a blog which was fun. Then we assigned each other nicknames. I was Patrick the Pedestrian, Josh was Josh the Journeyer, and Tyler was Tyler the Traveler. We even recorded intro videos which were quite funny.

										 Eventually, it was time to get back to the ferry. We hopped on and made our way over to the island. On the way over, it just barley started to rain. Thankfully, the boat had a roof so we were not getting drenched. By the time we arrived to the island, the rain stopped but it was still cloudy and windy. We walked the island and made our first stop at the Game of Thrones exhibit. It was interesting to see where all the Game of Thrones shots were filmed. We even go to take photos on a sword throne and sign our names in a logbook. Maybe one day I will find my signature again. As we walked to the beach, we took many pictures of the peacocks on the island. Tyler was obsessed with taking a portrait mode photo and Josh made it his goal to get a peacock to unfurl its feathers.

												We eventually made our way to the tide pool area which was a great stopping point. We walked on the rocks which were way sharper than I thought they would be. Then we gathered stones and had a stone skipping competition. I think Tyler won that one but he also kinda fell into the water haha. We then decided to try and make it over to the next area only stepping on the rocks. They were sporadically all over so we had to jump and make some long strides to get to the other side. Josh was lucky and had water shoes so he didn’t even have to jump from rock to rock.

												 Once we got to the other side, we decided to make a rock stack. We were inspired by another rock stack closer to the ground. I suggested we make it on top of a large boulder which made it a fun challenge. We started by gathering rocks and throwing them on top of the boulder. Then we climbing on top and started stacking. I didn’t realize there was a true art to stacking the rocks. Tyler had a ton of knowledge which was extremely helpful. Didn’t know you needed mini rocks in between to keep everything balanced. Once we were done, we took a step back to admire our work. I was quite impressed. We contributed journeying through the island. We found some awesome cliff jumping spots into the ocean but the conditions were way to rough. It would have been a bad idea to jump in. Instead, we went to the Dead Sea and swam there. I decided to climb up a rock wall and jump off. It was only 20ft+ but I was terrified. It took me a good 10 minutes but I eventually did it! It helped that a instagram influencers decided to film me and was up there for moral support.

													After having our fun at the watering hole, we checked out the gym equipment on the island, we were perplexed by these exercise wheels. Then we walked around the botanical gardens but there wasn’t anything too exciting there. Eventually, we headed back to the boat and made our way back to the old city. We decided to get reservations at a place called Taj Mahal, a Bolognese restaurant with local butchered meat. I was pretty excited for this since it was a Michelin recommended restaurant. We then went to go meet the other folks from the main hostel at a cliff side bar. The plan was to go cliff jumping but the conditions were not ideal. I chatted with Jason for awhile and he was a chiller. I was still eager to go cliff jumping and then all of a sudden a local Croatia popped out of nowhere and drove into the ocean. We were all stunned and watched as he skillfully moved about the water and timed his exit perfectly. I then went down to chat with him for a bit. Turns out he lives in Canada for awhile so his English was great. I talked to him about the conditions and he shared his method of exiting the water in case I wanted to still go in. After chatting I got a picture with him and rejoined my friends. I decided against getting in as it was getting dark.

													 We went back to the hostel to freshen up before going. We saw Hyla and Stella back at the hostel so decided to invite them as well. After gathering the troops, we headed down to Taj Mahal for a chill dinner night. We were so glad they understood we wanted to increase our party to 6 people. We eventually got our seats. While waiting, I was communicating with the hostel owner for the place we were going to stay in Hvar. Tyler and I decided to split the Genghis Khan meat plate for two. It was 100% the right move and costed the same as everyone else’s food. I got to try all the different types of meat which was so tasty. After dinner, we decided to go to a bar called Veterans bar and take a few shots of Cherry liquor. It was tasty but reminded me of medicine. Only 20 kuna though! After this, we were pretty tired so we headed back to get some rest.
