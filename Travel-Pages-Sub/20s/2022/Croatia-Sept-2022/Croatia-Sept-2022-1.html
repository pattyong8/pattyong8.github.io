												This was a top three trip of all time if not the best trip I have ever done up until this point. I met
												some truly amazing people, adventured without bounds, and experienced life like I have never before.
												This was the trip that convinced me that I must go hostel hoping in a foreign country at least once a year in my youth.
												Eric and I reconnecting as old best buds from our Seattle internship and experienced some of the most exciting parts of Croatia.
												Some highlights include the booze cruise with enroute friends, scuba diving in Hvar, and the Dubrovnik Old
												Town swimming spot.

											Epic backpacking trip #2! It was hard to contain my excitement walking through the SFO airport terminal. This was an especially rewarding vacation because the week before was likely my busiest week at Eastdil Secured with SF 105. I worked all through Labor Day weekend to get everything in order before I took off. No matter, that was all behind me and I only had new memories to look forward to. First stop, Copenhagen for a 20 hour layover!
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 The plan ride was uneventful. One good thing was that I was able to take my backpacking backpack with me. I watched a few movies, the action scenes from the Hobbit, and 1/5 of Tenant. Even got to sleep for a little! Also, I had great luck and didn’t have someone in the middle seat. The person I was sitting next to had been doing this same flight for the past couple years and knew the flight attendants. He even brought them all chocolates. So kind.

										I landed in Copenhagen airport and rushed my way to customs, just how mom taught me haha! I probably passed by 30-50 people. Turns out the line was super long so I definitely saved almost 30 mins of waiting. The line at customs was disorganized so I made my way to the front best I could. Was listening to a podcast on the Queen of England’s passing. So sad. As I made my way through the airport, I noticed tons of Joe & the Juices! I had no idea it was that popular in Denmark. I walked to parking lot #4 to store my large backpacking bag. I almost didn’t find a spot which would have been bad. I decided not to get an international phone plan for Copenhagen so had to take screenshots of where I wanted to go and then compare those to Google maps which shows your location on a map with or without service.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I figured out the metro, purchased my ticket, and made my way into the city. While on the train, there was a metro officer checking tickets and someone didn’t have one. He let them off the hook which was nice. The metro was clean and not too busy. On the way over to the city center, I found a walking tour that I was interested and decided my day would be spent visiting all the main tourist attractions. I got to the city center and walked out onto the main road. Wow was it beautiful! The architecture was stunning and reminded me of Boston, MA.

											 A few notable parts of the walking tour: Torvehallerne was a glass building food stall/court that reminded me a lot of the glass food stall/court that Vincent took us to in Spain when we visited him during his study abroad semester. Copenhagen had a ton of Michelin recommended and star restaurants; one of which I went to and will get into later. I saw 3+ wedding ceremonies while on my walking tour. This was likely because it was a Sunday in the summer. Such a great atmosphere. I went to visit Nyhavn which was beautiful! I sat on the side and people watched for a bit before continuing on my tour. Everyone biked everywhere! More bikes than I had ever seen before. Reminded me of a college campus. After Nyhavn, I grabbed a beer from 7-Eleven and drank it by the water. I got a few recommendations from a guy I met named Brady. He suggested I go visit Christiana Freetown. What an experience. I did not stay too long but I was very cool to visit. So many stands selling weed haha. Prob would have been a vibe if I had friends with me but not as much solo. I got to see the Queen of Denmark on her 50th anniversary. There was a ceremony for her. I waited almost an hour to see her; when in Copenhagen right?

												 For dinner, I went to a restaurant called Pluto. This was a recommendation from online and from Brady. They had local Denmark ingredients with Italian and French techniques. I was sitting at the bar and a mom and her son started talking with me. Their names were Ak and Theo. Turns out they were celebrating Theo’s 16th birthday. They traveled to Copenhagen because the drinking age was 16. I bought Theo some birthday chocolate cake to celebrate. The bar tender noticed and gave us a free drink and a birthday shot! What a great dinner night creating a lasting memory. For food, I got ceviche as a starter which came with some of the best bread and butter I’ve ever had. Then I had an entree with a white fish local to Denmark with a parmesan foam, roasted potatoes, and pickled lettuce. It was so good. I also had a mezcal cocktail and a glass of red wine.

												 After dinner, I walked around and explored more of the city. As I walked around the city center, I noticed that the city social scene was alive and popping. Literally every bar within a 10 block radius was full of locals drinking and gathering together. I was too tired to try my luck at a bar, I also had my backpack on me so didn’t was to wear it while out at a bar. Instead, I decided to sit by a store with free wifi and FaceTime mom. I also checked out the gay district, which was only two streets, but it wasn’t popping either. Because of this, I decided to head to the airport and take a nap before my flight.
												  </p>

													<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
													After grabbing my backpack from the airport locker, I learned that airport security was closed until 4am. Because of that, I had to take a nap on the airport floor right outside of security. Not the best sleeping spot in the world but was the most reasonable option. While sleeping, I locked my two bags together and wrapped the handles through my legs so no one could take my stuff. Also, I made friends with a couple traveling from the USA and ended up in the same lounge as me. The lounge was alright. I ate a bit and then headed to my flight for Croatia.

											Landed in Croatia! Woooohooo! I was so excited to meet up with Eric and start exploring the city that would be my travel site for the next twoish weeks. I took the main bus to the city center and was on my way. Everything was pretty well organized which was nice. As I was driving through the city, I noticed there were many different signs labeled Tommy. Turns out Tommy was a supermarket in Croatia. I’ll have to tell Tommy at Eastdil about this haha. After arriving on my bus, I walked up to Enroute hostel. It was a bit far from old town but I didn’t mind because I could tell that the accommodations were modern and clean. Just what I needed after not having slept for 48 hours.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I checked in and took a quick shower while waiting for Eric. I noticed a poster for deep water soloing! Omg I was pretty set on climbing (didn’t end up doing it which will be on the to-do list for next time). Eric finally arrived at the hostel and we were finally reunited after almost two years! Eric has always been one of my better friends in life that I got along so naturally with. Being able to finally travel with him was such an exciting opportunity/adventure. After catching up for a bit, I wanted to grab a Croatia SIM card. While in the common space, we met a girl named Maybellene. She came with us. We all ended up grabbing lunch at a mom and pop restaurant in Old Town. I got some risotto and calamari plus and Aperol Spritz!

											After lunch, we walked back to the hostel and decided to sign up for the booze cruise advertised at the hostel. Eric and I started meeting some folks in the common area and convinced a ton of people to go on the booze cruise with us. Those folks ended up becoming some of our best friends during the trip. There was Paul from Germany, Sky and Chrissy from the US, and Adam and Sean from the UK. We all started drinking of the hostel and built some solid friendships. We then decided to go drink at the beach and go for a swim before doing an impromptu bar crawl led by Crissy. Some of the group went to grab food. Maybellene, Eric, and I went to grab beer and grab a spot at the beach. We found large 2 L bottles of beer that was so cheap! We grabbed three of them for the group which seemed ridiculous at the time but we deleted them while at the beach.

											The others eventually met us at the beach and we hung out drinking beer and listening to music. Eric’s speaker was such a great move. Paul was talking to us about some great German techno rap music was I was crazy about haha. Need to play it when I’m home. For the bar hope, we started at Charlie’s bar. I bought drinks for the group and then we all hung out in the alley with everyone else. After that we headed to another bar where I bought Sean an alcoholic beverage I thought he would like and acquired my Croatia beer glass. We all took a picture on the Split Croatia red sign and then headed back to the hostel for bed before our big booze cruise day!

											Booze cruise day!!! What a freaking day this was. It ended up being my favorite day the entire trip not just because of the boat ride but because of the bonding that happened. We got up early around 8:45am for the 9:30am departure. We all woke up a little late so it was a rush to get down to the port and grab breakfast along the way. We made it there exactly at 9:30am but it didn’t matter since the boat was not ready to depart yet. While waiting, we made friends with Kai, Riley, Hyla, and Stella. They were all from the states and ending up becoming very good friends of ours.
											 </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 Eventually, the boat was ready to depart so we all got on. At first, the group started getting worried about the boat cruise and whether or not it was going to be fun. This was because there were families, older folks, and even a dog mixed in with those onboard. However, we were happy with the friends we had onboard and were confident we could have a good time amongst ourselves. On the way to the first stop, the crew brought out white wine and juice. We soon learned that white wine was our only free alcohol option but we didn’t care. Whatever got us drunk! We meet some others: the Italians, a few other Americans, and a few Germans. Everyone was such a great vibe. Things were starting to get more social as the white wine started to flow.

											Our first stop was lunch. The restaurant was situation on a beautiful beach with the bluest water I had seen in Croatia up until that point. So picturesque. While we waited for lunch. I decided to jump in the water and start swimming/snorkeling. It was all so much fun and I convinced Paul and Adam to get in. Unfortunately, Adam stepped on a sea urchin and got spins stuck in his big toe. Even more unfortunate was the boat, restaurant, and bar all did not have tweezers. I had to ask a random local Croatia women if we could borrow hers. It was an interesting interaction because she did not speak English. I used my phone to tell her we would give them back to her Chrissy sprang into first aid mode and tired to help Adam get the spines out of his big toe but to no avail.

												Our second stop was the Blue Lagoon. I was the only one that got a snorkel before they ran out so I let the group switch off using it. I was so excited once we stopped that I told Paul I wanted to be the first ones to jump off the boat and made a bee line for the top. We ended up jumping and it was loads of fun! We even got our entire group to jump at one point and got it on film. One of my favorite memories of the trip. At one point, there was a couple that looks like they were being pulled away by the current so I swam out to them to see if they needed help. They said they were fine. There was a larger German man that was trying to get up the ladder but was having trouble. His group of friends were all laughing which seemed mean but he was laughing to so I guess his weight was a running joke with his group of friends.
	They all blew up the slide at the second stop. I went down it once, head first but it wasn’t that cool. Afterwards, Sky, Paul, and I had a pull up competition on the water slide handles. Paul and I tied at 11 while Sky got 7. Was fun to do this competition since Sky is a climbing and Paul is into calisthenics. Good to know I could compete! Eric posted a pic of all of us to get a free beer. Woot woot.

 											Then we set off for our last stop, the shipwreck. I used the snorkeling gear to dive down and explore the ship wreck. At one point, I went through the haul of the ship and dove through it. Exhilarating! The water was so salty so I stoped snorkeling. Sky and I made it our goal to climb the boat in whatever way possible besides the ladder. At one point, we were climbing on a few extremities of the boat and everyone was watching us. We made that boat our bouldering wall for the day. I got random scratches throughout the day which was hilarious. Thankfully, I have my tetanus shot. We got a ton of sunset picture with the group. I had a few good conversions with Kai about his life and his own travels. Everyone in our group was amazing and so much fun to be around. Memories for a life time.

												Speaking of memories, this is where my memory started to drift a bit. We got back onto shore and I apparently carried 4 cups of white wine with me before heading out. Typically me haha. I kept trying to convince people I only drank 3 cups of wine. No one believed me haha. We then headed back to the hostel where I showered and passed out for two ours. Once I woke up, people had already eaten and been just hanging around the hostel. I decided to go out and stay up with Sky and Paul until their 5 am bus. I tried to rally Eric but he was sleepy. Chrissy came with us. Unfortunately, she has a blister on her toe. Ouch. We stopped by a Mexican restaurant for burritos, not my favorite. No rice or beans. Then we went downtown.

												 Chrissy was tired so she headed back. I just ended up chatting and hanging out with Sky and Paul until they needed to leave. We got pizza near the bus terminal. Then we saw a building labeled “Auotmatic Klub”. We thought it was a bar or club but turns out it was a casino. We left pretty quickly because it stank of cigarettes. Ewww. Then we headed back to the hostel where I said my final goodbyes to Paul and Sky. They were def some of my favorite people I have ever met while traveling so I was sad to see them go. Until next time.

											On our fourth day, we started eating breakfast. Honestly, the resort's options were not half bad! They had an omelette station and amazing hash browns! I even gave their chia seed pudding a shot. Something about what I ate did not sit well in my stomach because sometime later that day, I got food poisoning. Like every day before this one, we soaked in the sun on the white loungers. Davis wanted to meet up with Dr.Stocks later that night. I did not know how I was going to be able to handle it with my stomach but I decided it was important for Davis to see his mentor in the trading world. Although I knew he could go himself, I also knew he would like it more if I could go.

											We scheduled an early dinner at Ventanas. The dishes I got were actually amazing even with my food poisoning. Eating all of it was likely not a good idea haha. I had two lamb dishes and they were both very tasty. It was my second time getting the land shank and I was not disappointed. After eating dinner, Davis and I went back to the room and got ready to go out. On our way out, we decided we needed to acquire bug spray and sunblock. The options near the hotel were way too expensive so we decided to look elsewhere. We decided to walk to meet Dr.Stocks instead of calling a Taxi and figured he could help us acquire these items.

											 We met Dr.Stocks at a Starbucks near the main part of the city. He was very nice and seemed to have good intentions. He asked us if we wanted to explore the “real Mexico”. We happily obliged. We walked a few blocks West outside of the tourist zone to a famous Taco restaurant called El Nero. Even though my stomach was in a terrible shape. I could not pass up the opportunity to try some of the best tacos in Playa del Carmen. I decided to buy Dr. Stock’s tacos since he has been treating Davis so well. El Nero was out of most types of taco meat so we ended up getting El Pastor tacos. They were not my favorite but still very yummy. Unfortunately, those tacos put me over the edge and my stomach went very quickly downhill. Davis and Dr.Stocks shot a cool instagram story with boba and the chant from the Wolf of Wallstreet.

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 After dinner, Dr.Stocks took us to 10th Avenue to see the tourist sights. He showed us a hidden cenote at the bottom of a rug shop. That was so cool and a hidden gem on 10th street. While walking, I could tell my stomach was about to implode. I told them and we headed to a nearby mall where I threw up in the bathroom stalls. Food poisoning is never fun. Honestly, it was a relief to get the food out of my system. When I came out of the restroom, I saw Dr.Stocks and Davis in a deep conversation. Because of this, I decided to walk around the mall by myself for a bit. I explored a clothing store, tequila/chocolate store, and a formula 1 racing simulation. I remember while passing by that store front, the revving of the engines actually made me jump. The volume was so loud haha.

											 They eventually got up to look for me when they finished talking. We thanked Dr.Stocks for showing us around and parted ways. One of my favorite memories was when we were walking back with Dr.Stocks. We were walking on 10th Avenue when I noticed a group of three children performing street music for the tourists. I immediately knew that Davis was thinking about giving them money because that’s his personality. Without saying anything, I reached into my pockets and grabbed the change we had, said nothing to Davis, he turned to me, opened his hand and I dropped the change in his hands. He then put it in their donation hat. This is probably the most in sync moment we have ever had in our lives. Was a nice feeling that we know each other that well.
											  </p>

											 <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											 On the way back I asked Davis about what they talked about. He shared a number of things with me and we had another heart to heart on the way back. I am glad I was able to be there for that and that Dr.Stocks was able to give advice on the topic. Davis said he appreciated me for being there as a bigger brother and that I was a large part of his life. I told him it was literally the same feelings back. We are best friends. Once I got back, I threw up a bit more before showering and spending more time talking with Davis. I reminded him I would always be there for him and that he was one of the most important people in my life.

											This was the first day we got loungers with the mini sinkpool. To be honest, these were way more preferable because they were private and away from everyone else. We were also right on the beach which gave the seats a feeling of luxury. We got a little sunburnt over the last few days so we put on more sunblock and did a better job of staying in the shade. It was on this day that Davis got really into “Can’t Hurt Me”. He was reading faster than I have ever seen him read. I was very excited to see him take such an interest in the book. Since we were closer to the beach, locals would constantly come up to us trying to sell different items. There were even a few people that were trying to sell drugs lol.
											 </p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We chatted throughout the day and transferred from our loungers to the pool every hour or so. We started getting pails of ice with water bottles each day which gave us a constant source of hydration. It was on this day that we discovered the hot tub. Davis always thought it was another plungpool but turns out it was just a larger hot tub. Davis was a fan so we spent a good hour there before heading back to the room. To get ready for dinner.

											For dinner, we went to Spices, the Mexican restaurant on the property. Davis said this was one of his favorite places we have gone to yet! The vibe was more relaxed and the food was great! I would give it 4/5. The ribeye tostada was amazing and the desserts were to die for. Davis actually got a drink when we ate! We also got our fair share of cosmopolitans. Davis really liked his fish and said it was his favorite dish up until that point. Too bad we were only eating there once.

											Another day by the beach loungers with the private plunge pool. We were trying to soak in every last bit of time we had at the resort. You can tell that we were relaxing super hard because I do not have much to journal about for this day lol. The highlight of the day was going to the Japanese restaurant called Azia. We got the private dining room with the bamboo sliding doors. It was honestly so cool. Turns out this was our favorite restaurant on the property. The sushi wasn’t amazing but good enough. OMG the oxtail curry was to DIE FOR. So much oxtail and the curry was so rich. I told Davis we needed to go the next day, no exception. I also had the restaurant staff sing happy birthday to Davis even though it wasn’t his birthday. I just wanted to embarrass him haha. It worked LOL.

											This was our last day at the all inclusive. Mixed feelings because on one hand, I was ready to explore Playa del Carmen and get my scuba diving certification. On the other hand, I really enjoyed just relaxing everyday and spending some very welcomed quality time with Davis. I need more of him in my life. Since it was our last day, we decided to do the ruins biking tour. Turns out we got a private tour with Alfanzo since no one else signed up that day. Alfanzo showed us all the amazing ruins nearby and told us about the history of the area. He also took us through 10th Avenue, pointed out his favorite taco stand, and even went out of his way to bike us past the hotel we were going to after the all inclusive resort later that night. We made sure to tip him well.

											After the tour, Davis and I played a game of ping pong. Davis beat me but by a slim margin. We spent the rest of the day hanging out on loungers near the beach. We basically soaked in every last second of the all inclusive until our second dinner at Azia. We got lucky and our favorite loungers happened to be open! OMG what luck for the last day. Turns out it was best friends day so there were silly filters on snapchat to use haha. I got my typical fish tacos for lunch and just chilled until dinner. Azia was just as good as the time before. So yummy. Oxtail curry. :P. We took a taxi to our new hotel and then went to explore the taco stand Alfanzo pointed out. OMG these tacos were amazing. I knew at that point that I would be coming back haha.
