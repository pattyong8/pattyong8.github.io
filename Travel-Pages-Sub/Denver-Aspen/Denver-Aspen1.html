											This trip was dedicated to supporting both Connor and Lucas in their Spartan Race Ultra.
											I do not understand how they were physically able to run 30+ miles, complete 60+ obstacles,
											and still talk after the race. So impressive. Matt and I spent our time exploring the area,
											going on hikes, and waiting for Connor and Lucas to cross the finishline. Denver feels very
											similar to Seattle. Aspen was beautiful and the Maroon Bells were breathtaking. Glad I was
											able to experience a new city and support my best friends all in one trip!

											Just got picked up from the airport by Ryan and Connor. So nice to see both of them. We rode to the airport in a red car that Connor said barely works. Lol. Ryan actually almost didn’t make it back home after he dropped us off. Connor and I got through security, just did some small talk while going to the airport <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. I asked about his trip and his time at home. He talked about his day to day at home, his short LA trip, and his Croatia trip. Connor asked about the craziest thing on my Japan, Taiwan, Thailand trip. Connor and I finally got onto the plane after some delays. I got a window seat and started listening to a podcast that Dixon sent me. Excited to see Matt and Lucas! I did not enjoy the plane ride. There was an annoying baby in front of me and the guy next to me did not understand the idea of personal space.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											When we landed, we had to wait in the airport landing zone for an hour because there was backup in the gate loading zone. After what felt like a lifetime, we finally were allowed to disembark the plane. Connor and I walked quickly to the airport train and were right on time since the train was arriving as we got there. We called a Lyft and waited at zone 5, on floor 5, at island 5 lol. Our driver arrived and we got in. We picked up one more person since it was a pool. On the drive to Matt’s place, Connor and I talked about how excited we were to see Matt and for the rest of the trip. After we dropped off the first passenger, the driver jumped into the conversation after I started talking about backpacking through Asia.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The driver talked about her dogs for awhile. She spent the rest of the ride describing the physical appearance and traits of her dogs. How people in Denver love their dogs lol. Got to Matt’s apartment. His place was right above the Ritz Carlton. Omg haha. Matt and Lucas met us at the bottom of the building and brought us up. Ahhhh it was so nice to see them! We quickly got ready for bed and crashed. Before this, I eat an egg queso. I slept on the couch, Connor was in Matt’s bed and Lucas was on the pullout thing.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up the next morning to Connor and Lucas talking about random things. Matt had already left for work. Connor and Lucas asked me to cook breakfast so I did. I don’t mind and actually enjoy it :). I made an egg and ground turkey scramble with peppers, onions, and a touch of garlic. OMG Matt didn’t have salt! Who doesn’t have salt lol. I took down a mental note that I would make fun of him for it later. Matt came back for breakfast so I made him a portion as well. The toast was burnt but Connor called it crispy lol. We ate and they thanked me for breakfast.
											Talked briefly about life and how to deal with that mental obstacle. After breakfast, Matt went back to work and Lucas, Connor, and I went to get Matt’s car.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The car was in a parking garage not too far away. Apparently it was $40 a month. Wow that’s cheap. On the way, we passed by Matt’s work office. When Lucas pointed it out, we thought he was talking about another building. We got in the car and headed off to get supplies for Connor and Lucas’s first Spartan Race. During the car ride I decided to leave the GC full of my Newport Beach friends. I am very glad I left and know I will never look back. It was finally time to do so. I let Mom, Vincent, Tatum, and Davis know.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went to Target to get the supplies Lucas and Connor needed. I went to go find a bathroom and ended up at Starbucks since Target didn’t have one. We eventually finished up at Target and started heading back. After driving for 5mins, we decided we wanted Chipotle and ended up going to the one right next to Target lol.  Chipotle wasn’t open so we waited around for a bit <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. While eating, we briefly discussed society's mindset and motivations towards psychedelics. Interesting topic of conversation. Chipotle was quite satisfying. Once we were done, we went back to Matt’s apartment and met him there. Brought back some food, used the restroom, and got some of Matt’s things. Then we were off!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Connor noticed I was journaling and wanted me to write “Connor has a massive...”. Good one Connor. I have fulfilled your request. On the road, I started getting tired so I took a mini nap while they talked about work stuff and other things. I woke to a sudden jolt from a divot in the road <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. Lucas talked about his life. Then we got into a conversation about love and how it works. Then I asked Lucas about his job and learned more about his psychology consulting.
											We arrived at our Airbnb! Connor checked us in at the main lodge front desk. It was an interesting situation because the Airbnb was actually a part of what seemed like a resort. Essentially, they were using Airbnb as a platform to sell their empty rooms.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We checked in and got into the room. Very nice en-suite. Two beds and a pull out bed couch thing. We ate the rest of our Chipotle. Matt and I grabbed some white claws and accompanied Connor and Lucas to the registration area. Matt and I pointed out how hot it was. We were worried that Connor and Lucas would get badly sunburnt tomorrow. We all explored the festival area. Got some pictures of Connor and Lucas <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3, #4, & #5]</span>. We took mini gondolas up to the top. We walked over to the 2nd to last obstacle with the ring swing bar things. I got to try it and couldn’t complete it. Oh well. Maybe I’ll get better eventually.

											We walked back to the festival area. Connor went to check out the apparel area. He said he would probably go buy merch later. Then we went back to our Airbnb. Connor and Lucas decided to prep themselves while Matt and I went to get groceries. We got chuck chunks and tri tip. :)  Once we got back, I made dinner for everyone. Matt also wanted to learn how to make mashed potatoes so I showed him how. I grilled the tri tip and seared the chuck. We all ate dinner and then Lucas and Connor crashed. Matt and I watched a movie and drank white claws. Really could not feel the alc at all. We drank around 4 of them. We were watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Then we also fell asleep as I tried to put on the fight scene from Endgame. The bed was super uncomfortable. Lots of springs and uncomfortable pullout. But we let Connor and Lucas take the beds because they were racing the next day.

											Got woken up by Lucas and Connor and moved to their beds. Wished them luck and sent them off. Woke up later around 9 and ate breakfast with Matt. We decided to go to the Maroon Bells and hike near Maroon Lake. We headed off and went to Marron Lake. We got to the ranger station and got told we had to take a bus into the park and couldn’t drive in. So we had to drive 3 miles backwards to a parking lot, pay $15 for parking and then pay $16 for the bus. I was laughing at the fact that we had to pay to hike but whatever. Complained about it to Matt for a bit lol. We got on the bus. Turns out the bus was a tour guide style bus <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. The driver was telling us about the history of Aspen (the silver mining and deal), different trees/animals, and avalanches.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got to the lake and omg it was beautiful. The Maroon Bells looked beautiful and the lake was picturesque <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2 & #3]</span>. We started our hike on the Crater Trail. At first I was keeping up a very fast pace. Hiking quickly seemed to be really nice, haha. I loved the feeling of working hard. Matt wasn’t really keeping up and also voiced his want to hike slowly and just talk. So I slowed down and we started to chat about random things: relationship stuff, life after his first job, the vibe of Denver, etc. We eventually got to Crater Lake which was beautiful <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4 & #5]</span>! I decided to skip some rocks. I got 7 skips consistently on the first three rocks I threw. The other rocks weren’t great so I couldn’t skip them much.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Matt and I also had a rock throwing competition. He threw it further than me haha. I wanted to walk to a waterfall but it seemed too far away. We walked back to the first lake. It started getting really sunny. I thought we were lost for a bit and then weren’t haha. Got back to the first lake and went straight to the bus. On the bus, I started to talk to Matt about my philosophy on friends. I was saying that I value friends a lot and best friends are very rare to me. Matt kinda agreed but also said he is more cautious when making friends then I am. He makes fewer friends and looks for quality while I look for a mix between the two. Funny enough, as we were talking about this, JR and I were texting about me leaving the GC and borderlands 3

											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got back to the car and continued our convo for a bit more. We then went into Aspen town and ate at the Red Onion. They served burgers and that were a bit on the expensive side. I got a chicken lime burger and Matt got a regular burger <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #6]</span>. The town was quite peaceful and very community- like. It seemed like a very nice ski town. Then we left to make it back in time to watch Connor and Lucas finish their race. We walked up to the obstacles. Yes, we didn’t have to pay which was clutch. It was more because we were living in the condos next to the race. We could see the race from our window.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After moving around from place to place, we found an amazing location to sit at. It was in between some condo porches with a view right next to the race path <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>. Matt and I posted up here and just sat around for a bit. After waiting for an 1hr and 30mins, we decided to get beers at the ranger station. I got two hazy voodoos. So good. I paid since Matt has been paying for a ton of other things. We had our beers and we’re waiting around. Then suddenly, Connor rounded the corner! Omg yay! We ran with him to the obstacles and took videos of him and cheered him on <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #8]</span>. Omg it was sooo awesome seeing him cross the finish line! Connor didn’t seem tired at all.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then we walked back to our waiting spot. Connor sat down for a bit. Matt and I decided to go check out the restaurants in the top area. I got Connor oxygen and Matt got beers for us. The restaurants didn’t take reservations. We went back to the waiting area. Connor went to go buy tons of merch. Matt and I talked politics for a bit. Connor got back. We waited for a bit longer before Lucas rounded the corner with a group he had been racing with <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #9]</span>! Yay! He looked way more tired than Connor. After he did the ring monkey bars thing, I helped him down the hill and he finished the race! Yay! I made sure to get lots of pictures of Connor and Lucas. We decided to go back to our Airbnb. They showered off and relaxed while Matt and I got them food, ice, and salt. I bought groceries for that night.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got back and started cooking. A super hot pan that I put butter in started smoking way too much. Had to open the door and windows to air it out. We had chicken thighs, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, pasta, and mashed potatoes. They could barely eat the food so they just ate what they could. Then we threw on a romantic comedy called No Strings Attached. I mentioned out loud that Ashton Cutcher is def in the top 10 for attractive actors. Connor and Lucas had their ice baths. Then we all went to sleep. I slept in the bed with Connor since the pull out couch one was way too uncomfortable.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											Got up the next morning. Ate some leftovers and hung out with the guys. Turns out my phone wasn’t charging the entire night. Wow. We packed up and cleaned up and left. Before we got on the road, we went to go check out the town of Aspen. We walked around, grabbed Starbucks, and showed them around the area Matt and I explored yesterday. They seemed to love the mini town as much as we did. Then we hoped back in the car and started our journey back to Denver. The first half wasn’t too bad. I fell asleep for a bit. Connor and Lucas were talking about different types of consulting.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then we stopped at a gas station to use the restroom. Connor and Matt switched driving because there was a ton of traffic coming up. About a 42min delay. Ughhh. It started to rain pretty hard. We had interesting convos again. Started to talk about LGBTQ+ issues and my perspective. Lucas mentioned that there was another Spartan Race in Montana next year that he wanted to do. This got me and Matt interested in maybe doing something of the sort. Lucas also brought up adventure racing which was also a cool idea. It incorporates multiple disciplines such as kayaking, hiking, navigating, and sometimes CLIMBING haha.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We started getting closer to Denver. We all went back to Matt’s place. Connor took a nap. Lucas, went out to hangout with his other friends. Matt and I just hung around until it was time to wake up Connor. We then got dressed and went out. Connor decided he wanted to have a juicy burger so we went to the Thirsty Lion. We walked 17th and 16th street. 16th street was basically an open street mall. Very cool to see. Matt had us walk both just to see them. We arrived at the Thirsty Lion. It was extremely similar to Yard House. We all got beers and food.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We left the thirsty lion and were planning on going to the jazz fest in the park but it started to drizzle a bit so we hung out in Matt’s place instead. We all started drinking beers and watching a new show that Connor loved on Netflix called “I think you should leave”. After 2 episodes, we decided to head to Rhino for a couple breweries. We took electric scooters to our first location. It was a massive game house with life size beer pong, golf disk, and corn hole. Matt bought our first round. We had a really good time. This place didn’t have IPAs so I settled with a kolsch. We played a big beer pong game <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. First round was Connor vs me and Matt. Second round was all three of us against two other guys.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We crushed them in the first round and then got beat the second one. After this game, we decided to leave. I got a really cool glass from this place! The walk to the next place was no more than 5mins. We checked out a place called Patio but I wasn’t a huge fan of the vibe. So we decided to walk over to a brewery called Odell’s. They had an amazing hazy ipa that really hit the spot <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>. While drinking our beers, we played Exploding Kittens. Then we went to go check out the roof. I got another glass from this place! They were closing so we had to leave. We took scooters home again. Connor and I lost Matt along the way. Turns out he took an alternate path and went to go pee in the apartment before coming back down and opening the door for us.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We went up stairs and got settled. I decided I was hungry and started to cook something. I made an egg queso with salsa <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. Super yummy. We talked with a good bonding talk about relationships. Connor and I approached the topic in different ways. Then the convo ended because Connor was tired. I took a shower and then went to sleep as well. Matt decided to sleep on the couch instead of his bed since Connor was in it.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Connor woke up in a bit of a frenzy at around 6am. Turns out Frontier accidentally booked a flight from SNA to Denver instead of Denver to SNA. The only flight he could take was at 8:30am so he had to rush off! Matt drove him. I opted out on going. He made it thankfully. He needed to because he was going on a trip to Bruin Woods with his family. Matt got back and I woke up again. We decided to eat breakfast and go on a hike in Boulder. I made eggs and bagels. I accidentally dropped the pan with a few eggs in it so I had to make more.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We ate and talked. Matt seemed pretty motivated around the idea of doing a marathon. I am not as into the idea of a marathon but am keen on a shorter distance race I can train for. After breakfast, we walked to the parking garage, checked out the paint scrape from Lucas driving Matt’s car, hopped in the car and headed to Boulder. Boulder was beautiful and the school was all the same type of building. The Flatirons were an absolutely amazing rock formation. We went straight to the trailhead and started the hike. I went to the restrooms before the hike. There were so many flies in the restroom. I thought it was funny that many of the flies we attracted to the human waste and not the fly trap right next to the toilet. Lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We started on the hike. It was intended to be moderate and yah, it kinda was. The first part of the hike was literally all stairs omg. I still managed to do well though. I stopped very often during the beginning of the hike because there were so many boulders to climb <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1 & #2]</span>! Chalk was everywhere and I really wanted to attempt most of them. Matt thought it was funny that I loved the boulders so much. Honestly, I wanted to both check out the climbs and needed a break from the hike. Lol Towards the end of the climb it got really hard. I had to stop pretty often. My mind was hazy and a bit light headed but I mustered the strength to continue on. During the hike, we talked about live stuff, him wanting to do a marathon, and things about Denver and Matt’s attitude.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We stopped at an unmarked boulder and I had both of us climb it. Matt was scared haha but was fine after topping out. We finally got to the top of the hike! Omg it was beautiful <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>. But as we were chilling up there, thunder and rain clouds started to roll in. We realized that no one else was around so we decided to walk down. As we were walking down the rain really started to come down. We talked about the purpose of social media and how it allows people to know what we are doing and share about our daily lives. True because multiple people messaged me about my trip on snapchat! Ughhh it got very slippery and my shoes weren’t the best. I was being very careful on the way down.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I kept on saying that I wanted to reattempt the climb that I tried on the way up. It was funny because as soon as I got to that point, the rain stopped and the sun came out. It was as if I was given a sign that I should climb it. I tried but my shoes were just too bad. Then we moved on and came upon the traverse. Matt and I took pictures on the rock. Then I gave the traverse a good attempt. It was super fun but I fell halfway through the route. The fall was a bit awkward so I decided not to attempt it again. We got in the car and went into the town of Boulder.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We ate at a place called Mountain Sun Pub and Brewery <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span>. Super fun. I got a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and Matt got a special burger. We asked them to cut the burgers and split them. Turns out they split the entire dish! Also, our waiter heard us talk about not having enough money and offered to get us a beer for free. Wow that was nice. I mentioned to Matt that I wasn’t a fan of eating and drinking beer or drinking beer after eating. I think it messes with my taste buds or something. Then we went to the Dark Horse Tavern to eat Rocky Mountain oysters (bison testicles) <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #5]</span>. Lol.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The venue was cool. Totally a dive bar. The Rocky Mountain oysters were not that great. Kinda reminded me of skin but there was no salt. Maybe if it was seasoned better. It was cheap though so it didn’t matter to me! We also played darts. I made a comeback and beat Matt. As we left, I realized I left my sunglasses at the Dark Horse Tavern. We went back to get them. Yay! I found them. Then we drove back to Denver. There was a bit of traffic. We talked about my group chat and our motivations in life. Scotty texted me asking what I was doing the next day and saying that he understands why I left the GC.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got back to Denver and chilled for a bit before heading to Matt’s first speakeasy! I kept it a secret and took him to William and Graham. Super nice and acclaimed bar. Wonderful cocktails. I got a gin based drink with mint and lemon <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #6]</span>. Super yummy. Matt got a version of an old fashion but with bourbon instead of rye. Both drinks were around $16 and I covered it. Very worth it since it was Matt’s first time. We talked about my motivations about going into VC and wanted to explore the option a bit more. Wasn’t entirely sure it was a good fit but wanted to research it a bit more. We talked about income levels and how to live a happy life.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We left and headed to the other speakeasy. It was in an ice cream shop called frozen matter. The bar itself was called retrograde. The entrance was way better than the entrance at William and graham. I got the ghost ship cocktail <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>. Not my favorite. I wanted something creamy but that was just too adventurous of a drink since it had umami flavor profiles. Matt got another drink that I was okay with <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #8]</span>. We left and they gave us a card to get free ice cream with a yelp review. I made friends with the owner Ian! Help was very nice and helped me get the coupon code by responding to my review right away. I made sure to be super nice and offer to give a review for both locations. He gave us two free ice creams! He told us that all the ice cream is made from scratch and that they have their own pasteurizer omg! Matt didn’t realize I had also gotten him a free ice cream haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We thanked them and left. Then we went to safeway. We got some tomatoes and toothpaste. Then we headed back. As we were entering our building, there was a homeless man that wanted water. I brought out two cups for him. Couldn’t let him in the building though. Then Matt and I went up. I started cooking dinner. Since Matt didn’t have salt, I had to season everything with other spices. No worries. We made tacos which were super tasty. He mentioned that it literally took me no effort to cook. That is true haha. It comes easy to me. We watched a bit of “Our Planet” before Matt said he was tired and we went to sleep. I packed, set alarms, and went to bed.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up at 4am. Did last minute packing things and work Matt up to say goodbye. Called my Lyft and waited downstairs. Accidentally put the pin at the wrong place so I had to walk to the Lyft. The driver was an old man. There were two people from Ireland in the car. The gentleman commented on us traveling and said that we had to travel while we are young because traveling is different in the lens of a younger person. I liked that advice. Then the driver talked about how he used to be a weed dealer and how making things illegal only makes others want it more and creates “black market” esq situations.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Then he started talking about guns. He was a supporter of gun ownership and took the same stance on guns like he does with drugs. He cited that he doesn’t trust the government and believes that guns are the only thing stopping the government from becoming “big brother”. He doesn’t read the news or watch tv at all. The Irish guy in the car was passively voicing his opposing view and stating that he disagrees. It was interesting to observe this debate. He dropped us off and it was a friendly exchange of goodbye. Security was a bit longer than expected and there were trains to the main Terminal. Thankfully, it didn’t take too long and that I had enough time. Got on the plane and headed home. I actually was able to sleep on the flight <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>! Not comfortable but it went by fast because of it. Successful Trip Done!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Concluding thoughts
											Trip was nice. Nice to reconnect with Matt, Connor, and Lucas on a more personal level. I made sure to be there for all of them by making food and supporting Connor and Lucas during their race. Connor said one of his motivations to finish the race was that Matt and I would be at the finish line to cheer him on. I think it was good for us to have gone at the time we did so that we could be there for Matt. Denver was hotter than CA but more beautiful! I am glad I left the GC. I have wayyy better friends now. I might be more motivated to do a large race after watching them do a spartan race. We will see though lol. I will try and make weekend trips to see friends more often.

																	<p>This was such a fun trip I'm glad you invited me and showed me an experience I won't ever forget.
																		Even though I got super sick and felt like I was dead, it was one of the coolest experiences ever,

																		I never realized how amazing they truly are and I definitely wanna play with them again. Thanks again for
