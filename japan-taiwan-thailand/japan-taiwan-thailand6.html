											Got up late and called the front desk. They had extended our checkout to 1pm. Yay! Kept researching Koh Phi Phi hotels for over an hr. God I’m so indecisive. I need to work on this habit. Eventually, with Davis saying he didn’t care, we decided on a highly rated hostel and booked it. We finally went downstairs to book a ferry to Koh Phi Phi. Turns out everything was full for today... Omg this was a terrible outcome! I can’t believe I hadn’t planned out this part yesterday. Oh well. There was nothing that could be done. We decided to extend our stay at Centra. We got an upgrade to a poolside view! I also made sure to book ferry transportation for the next day, round trip. We finally were done and put our stuff in the new room. It was around 2pm at this point. Made our way down to Ao Nang using a random red bus. The guy actually took us the opposite the direct for a bit to run an errand and then took us. Once we got there, I bought us tickets to railay and then decided against it again. Instead, I opted to rent kayaks and kayak there instead haha. We returned the tickets and were off. We walked down to the only kayak place on Ao Nang. The rental face price was 750 baht but I was able to bargain it down to 600 baht. It was probably still a ripoff.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We wrapped our stuff in trash bags, in an attempt to keep our stuff dry and were off. I did most of the paddling since Davis was sick and thus tried. I told him to rest and just enjoy the ride. I am glad I put on sunblock because the sun was full blast around this time. We kayaked past Railay and, instead, went to the beach on the right of the main beach. As we rounded the corner, we noticed that this beach was way more secluded. Davis seemed to like this a lot. I am glad we went there then since it was more relaxing. We lounged on the beach for a bit before deciding to explore more of the area. We walked to another island that was accessible by sandbar <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>. We made a very dumb mistake of leaving our money and important stuff behind with the kayaks. Thankfully nothing happened.
											</p>

												</div>
											</div><!-- /.col -->

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The island was cool but the walk over was painful since most of the sandbar was populated by corral and random shells. Also, we realized that if anyone stole our stuff at that moment, we wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. Checkout the island and then walked back to the kayak. Grabbed the important stuff and then walked to a floating boat food stand <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2]</span>! I got fried rice, pad see yew, and Thai ice tea. Davis got fries and fried shrimp spring rolls. Omg the fries were actually really good! Davis and I were happily surprised. We sat down ate and then decided we should head back and return the kayaks. The paddle back was harder since we were going against the current. It didn’t help our situation that Davis was exhausted and I was dehydrated. We somehow eventually got back. I told Davis to relax and only paddle when he wanted to. We saw another group of three kayakers capsize twice lol. Figured it was because the guy in the back was leaning way too far back.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Got back to the kayak place at 6:15pm and they, thankfully, didn’t charge us more for a late return. We walked back to the main area of Ao Nang. We decided to stop at Ao Nang beach to watch the sunset for a bit. We just chatted about random stuff as the sun was setting <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3]</span>. Related random clouds to league lol. Aurelian Sol lol. Davis put his hair up in a bonnet looking thing. Lol. Was funny haha. Once the sun set, I started to make a ransoms sand structure by piling sand and making a round ditch around it. Decided to head out. On our drive back we talked about each other’s first times. Got back to the hotel and showered. Before going up, I cleared up details about Koh Phi Phi transport with the travel person at the front. Got two more drink tickets since we checked into a new room. 😁 Took a shower and chilled with Davis for awhile. We watched some funny smosh videos lol. Then decided to get a massage yet again lol. The guy said he would come in 10 mins lol. Quick service!

											Used our drink tickets to get some OJ. We got another massage <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4]</span>. This time we were directed to the outside area which looked kinda fancy was nice. I asked for mosquito spray since I had a ton of bites. The lady was super accommodating. She used a natural mosquito repellent with the ingredient used in Tom yam. Cool.  Finished our massage and tried to walk around for a bit. We realized it wasn’t worth it and headed back to Centra. Had the guy drop us off at the noodle joint that I had been eyeing down <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #5]</span>. Omg it was amazing! The broth was rich, chicken was moist, and noodles on point. After this, we went to a 7-11 and got floss. Davis was hungry so we went to go find food for him. He got shrimp fried rice at a random place. I got fries because we kept wanting to try fries now haha. However, the ones we got were not that great. Got back to the room and took a shower. Davis and I started to have a deepish talk. We discussed out perceptions of the world, people we love, and goals/aspirations. After chatting for a bit, we fell asleep.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up early the next morning to leave for Koh Phi Phi. Was super excited about this part. Gonna meet Millie there. The weather in the morning was beautiful <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>! We waited for our van for a while and before it finally arrived. As we were driving, it started to rain quite hard :(. We were hoping this wouldn’t get in the way of our day at Koh Phi Phi. Got on the boat and headed to the island. When we first arrived, the weather was amazing! Omg it was gorgeous! Walking off the boat was like walking into paradise. We had to pay a cleaning fee to get onto the islands. I later learned that the tourism on Koh Phi Phi was creating tons of trash. Since it is an island, they have to ship their trash to the mainland. Apparently, it is quite and expensive process so they charge tourist the cleaning fee to help with the cost.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We dropped off our stuff at the hostel and then went to meet up with Millie. She was on a beach somewhere on the island but we didn’t know which one. However, the island was small so it didn’t take long to find her. Since the weather was great, we decided to lounge on the beach for a bit. We all took a nap on the beach while waiting for our snorkeling tour/hostel check in. Unfortunately, we woke up to what looked like a brewing storm. We decided to go eat lunch and pray that the weather would let up. We ate at a place called basil cafe <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2 & #3]</span>. They had amazing curry! Then we walked to the hostel and were told that our snorkeling trip was cancelled due to weather! 😢 Omg I was sooo sad since this was our only day on the island. I mean come on! I really wanted to do this and was bummed we wouldn’t experience this in Thailand.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We instead opted to do a hike suggested by Jason the hostel owner. Omg Jason was a loaded Brit. I mean, he was full of energy and was immediately friendly with everyone. He definitely knew his way around the island. However, there was something about his attitude that made me think he was a bit shady. Maybe I’m just being overly critical. Anyways, we started our walk and were passing by some shops when Davis decided to buy Marci a necklace. We were able to bargain it from 450 baht to 250 baht. As we were bargaining it started to rain super hard. We took shelter in a nearby scuba diving center. They ended up trying to sell us on scuba diving in the storm. Not sure if I was sold on being in the Ocean during a thunderstorm. Davis decided to go buy the necklace. Omg the rain was coming down soooo hard! Throughout my trip in Asia, I noticed rain in these rainy countries are composed of larger drops than at home.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We told the scuba diving instructor that it was too expensive and ran back to the hostel. We took shelter in there and tried to figure out what we wanted to do. Eventually, the rain let up a bit so we decided to go walk around and get a massage. We walked all the way to the cliff beach hotel that I had considered staying at since it had an infinity pool and ocean view. Millie and Davis expressed that they felt extremely tired so we went to go get a massage. We got an oil massage instead of a Thai massage. I liked them equally as much. Davis and I got our own area while Millie got her own. We enjoyed our massage that we were able to bargain down from 300 baht to 250 baht. Wow that was relaxing. We then headed back to the hostel to chill and figure out what to do. When we went back we figure out that not only was it raining but we also went to Koh Phi Phi on one of the days drinking in Thailand was illegal due to a religious holiday lol. Omg.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I tried making a reservation at a sushi restaurant for our layover in Japan but couldn’t speak Japanese. Thankfully, there was a person in the hostel that could speak but I ran out of minutes before she could finish the conversation. No worries. She could also speak Chinese and criticized me for my terrible accent lol. A ton of people from the hostel wanted to go eat at an Indian place recommended by the British expat hostel owner. We decided to go. I got butter chicken that was pretty shit haha. Davis got a veggie curry. It was kinda pricey. Funny note, when we sat down, everyone got a Indian food menu besides me. I was handed a Thai food menu lol. Apparently, I look Thai haha. We paid but not fully because somehow someone miscalculated their bill. We walked around for a bit and went to a scuba diving shop for the girls to sign up for a lesson the next day. Davis was tired so we sat down for a bit.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We then figured out there was a place serving alcohol so we went! When we got there, I wasn’t sure if I wanted a drink. I didn’t get one at first but then Millie made us stay and hangout. Omg our topic of convo was about ping pong shows in Thailand. Like the ones with girls shooting ping pongs out of their vaginas. I did not see this in Thailand but apparently most of our other traveling friends had. Once we were done with our drinks, we left and headed back to our hostel. We all took showers and got ready for bed. Davis and I hung out for a bit before going to sleep.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We woke up and packed up our things and headed out. We got our stuff and left. We barely had any cash so I had to exchange $100 US worth. We took the boat back and went straight to the airport . At the boat dock we had to pay extra for the bus from the dock to the airport but I bargained it down from 150 baht to 100 baht <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>. We got to the airport which was tiny! I got a Thai green curry cup noodle and we just hung out until our flight. I kept wishing I had the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card and lounge access haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											We got on our flight and went to Bangkok. Got to Bangkok and decided to send it and check out a speakeasy even though it was a no alcohol day. We took a taxi and got to the bar. It was closed! 😥 Super disappointing. But at least Davis was able to see the cool entrance. Instead, we went to a Singapore food place <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #2]</span>. Super yummy chicken juice rice with chicken and a variety of pork. Davis got shrimp fried rice. Then we took another taxi to the airport. We got on our plane in Bangkok and were off. My seat reservation scheme worked! Davis and I got an entire 4 person row to ourselves <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3]</span>. I let Davis layout during the entire flight. He seemed comfortable.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											We landed in Osaka! I already knew what we were going to do and where we were going to go. As soon as we got off the plane, we walked straight to the train system and got a ticket to the Pax Hostel. On the train, Davis was really tired and napped. For the first time, he leaned on me without asking. It felt nice that he trusted me and felt close enough to do that. We got off the train and walk to the Pax. I introduced Davis to the lady at the from of the Pax. I forgot her name lol. We put our bags in the baggage area and were off! We took the train to the sushi place that we wanted to go to. Omg this sushi place was amazing <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1, #2, & #3]</span>. It was in a popular shopping area in Osaka. There was a line out the door before the place even opened! The fish quality was amazing, the portions were large, and popularity through the roof. Davis loved it haha! I am so glad because I didn’t think he was a huge fan of the food in Thailand.

											After this we were both pretty full. We decided to walk around for a bit <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #4]</span>. Then I decided to take Davis to the Osaka castle <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #5]</span>. We took the train there and then walked to the base of the castle. We explored the area for a bit. Davis thought it was cool. Then we left the area and headed for the funny animie sex toys shop that Noah and I had explored. I kept it a secret from Davis and had him guess where we were going haha. He eventually guessed where we were going. It was super funny to just look around the store again. I made Davis hold the big massive dildo hahah. Then it was about time to leave. We headed back to the Pax, used the restroom, drank some water, and headed out.

											Once we got to the main station at the airport, I tried to return my Japan metro card but they told me I could only trade it back in at Tokyo and not in Osaka. Oh well I guess it can serve as memorabilia instead haha. We got through security and waited for our flight. We made a pile of tissues from us blowing our noses haha. I had actually taken a roll of toilet paper from the restroom to use lol.  It was here that I realized I had left my toiletries bag and sunglasses at the hostel in Koh Phi Phi. Omg of course on my last day traveling, I forget something. Ughhhh. We boarded the plane. My plan to have Davis and I have a row to ourselves worked yet again. I booked a window seat and aisle seat one row apart and just asked the lady that sat next to Davis if I could switch with her. It worked! Davis slept for most of the flight. I watched movies instead haha. I let Davis lean on me to sleep. At one point, I swiveled around and let him practically use me as a sideways bed. Then food came. Davis didn’t eat any of the food so I ate it for him haha.

											We landed <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1]</span>! I expressed to Davis again how much I loved the trip and how surprised that I wasn’t annoyed with him at all during the entire duration of the trip. He totally agreed with me and said we should go on more trips together. Usually that happens to everyone, but Davis and I were different. He is like family to me so I could never get annoyed by him. We got through customs and immigration very quickly which was a nice surprise. Davis’s mom picked us up and we got In-N-Out. What a fantastic trip!

											Concluding thoughts:
											Thailand was the most memorable leg of the trip because I got to spend a ton of quality time with Davis. He will always be a part of my life and it’s cool that we now have this amazing experience to look back on. Taiwan reaffirmed that I can’t have dad be a large part of my life. I can’t live with him because he hasn’t changed enough from his old self. I am glad we both got a bit of closure during the trip though. Japan was soooo sick but expensive. Noah is an amazing travel buddy and someone I will always be friends with. I am sure we would stay in touch based on our interest in climbing alone. Overall, traveling abroad has opened my eyes to the world of backpacking. It is something that I want to do a lot of and fit into my schedule. The best would be if I could travel with one friend and then stay at hostels and make new friends. Truly an experience of a lifetime and something I want to have happen again!

																<p>This was such a fun trip I'm glad you invited me and showed me an experience I won't ever forget.
																	Even though I got super sick and felt like I was dead, it was one of the coolest experiences ever,
																	traveling all over Thailand and a little bit of Japan. The elephant nature park was definitely a highlight,
																	I never realized how amazing they truly are and I definitely wanna play with them again. Thanks again for
																	everything and making it such a fun time!
