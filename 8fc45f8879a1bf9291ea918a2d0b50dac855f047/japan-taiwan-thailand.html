											This trip served as my post graduation period of global exploration. My aim
											was to experience a multitude of cultures, feast upon exotic foods, and gain
											a true understanding of backpacking. With clear eyes and a full heart, I set
											off to Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. I traveled with Noah, a good friend I
											made while interning at Amazon, and Davis, my little brother mentee
											from high school. Due to my extroverted nature, I made tons of friends on
											this trip. I am thankful for this life experience. It will be
											one I will always remember with fond memories and wild moments.

											Yay I arrived! I will skip the section where I land plus airport logistics.
											One thing I will note is my first interaction buying a metro ticket in Japan.
											It was cheap, fast, and effective. The metro company even had a help desk
											at the airport terminal for first time travelers such as myself. The metro
											ride took about one hour. At one point, I thought I had taken the wrong train
											and almost got off to figure out where I was. Not having data was a tad bit rough.
											This showed me how truly dependent I was on access to the internet.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											I finally got to the hostel with the help of maps.me. Good thing I downloaded it
											before my trip. Noah was waiting for me in the lobby with a few friends he made
											while waiting for me. After a bro hug, Noah introduced me to his two new friends.
											Their names were Ashe and Seth. Ashe went to Berkeley and graduated in 2018! What
											a coincidence. Seth is from Hawaii. They gave us lots of good transit advise.
											After chatting for a bit, I decided to get a beer. I got a Suruga Bay Imperial IPA
											<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. The beer was pretty good. I also \
											checked in at the front and was given my floor plan and door code <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Within
											five minutes of finishing my beer we decided to go for some ramen. Ichiran was the
											ramen joint of choice. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span> It was super
											yummy! For desert, we went to a random grocery store. I got a macha sponge cake.
											After this, we headed back to the hostel and turned in for the night.

											Shibuya stop for food. Stopped at 7-11 disappointed it wasn’t cool. Pulled out 50,000.
											Takeshita street!. Went to an omakase called Karuku. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>
											Subpar service, chefs didn’t talk.
											Costed around $170. Not worth. Went to the imperial palace, couldn’t go in. Got pictures.
											Joked about jumping the palace wall. Marunouchi house. Beer and water and chilling.
											Stopped for chicken cutsu at random fast food joint. Pokémon cafe. Super fun gift shop with
											interactive touchscreen. Cool pic with sculpture snorlax. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>
											Iced Noah cus I thought it would
											be funny. It was. Drinking with Noah and Lasse and hanging out drinking sake and beer.
											Lasse is from Denmark and owns his own skateboarding company. MRT with Noah and Lasse.
											Said bye to Lasse. Went to a jbbq place but it was closed. Went to big crossing street.
											Got a sick video. Went to a JBBQ place called yakiniku bar. After we tried to find a place
											called beat bar, we couldn’t find it. Instead went to a gyoza place and randomly met people
											named Dean, joe, Kannada. Went with them to find beat bar. Found it. Drank a beer there
											but it was very smokey. I wasn't a huge fan. Also jumped to another bar with a 1000 yen fee.
											Not a great drink or good vibe. 😢Left to get home at the right time. Got on the last train
											home but the journey was tedious because we had to hop from train to train to taxi to get home.

												Got up at 6:45am to got on the 8am train to Osaka. Gonna see Shane and Dixon 😁
												Tickets were expensive! Forgot to take a video while on the train. 😥 Met up
												with Dixon and Shane. Went to a sumo massive portion size restaurant. Ate jiaoza
												 and the egg wth ketchup over rice. Did a little arcade shooting game trying to
												 shoot down candy. Didn’t get anything. Walked to a park and bridge where we went
												 live on Shane's Instagram. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>
												 Has a funny “pretend we saw each other for the first
												 time in japan” video. Dixon tried speaking to girls in kimonos and they could
												not speak Japanese. Turns out they were Korean and just dressing up for fun.
												Was super awkward lol. Random art gallery thing. Buddhist temple/shrine where we
												sat and looked at the sculptures. Walked backed to the hostel and said bye to
												Dixon and Shane. 😢 Chilled out with Noah and listened to him play the guitar.
												Checked into a new hostel called “Home”. Super nice hostel. Feels like a shared
												hotel almost. At the oversized boba. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>
												Took a nap while Noah went and talked to the girl employee at Shane
												and Dixon’s hostel. Hookup a reservation tomorrow for food and maybe drinks tonight?
												😊
												</p>
												<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												When I woke up we went to the tea place next door and had tea using our free 1
												drink coupon from the hostel we are staying at. Went back to the old hostel. Met
												Jordan and another friend. Left the hostel. Talked to Noah about my dad and my
												childhood situation. Went out to dotonburi. Ate subpar sushi with Noah ordering
												random things in random bursts. Prob super overpriced. The streets were really cool!
												Lots of tourists and good vibes. Went to a random bar and had an expresso martini.
												Super expensive prob but very effective. Went to a bar alley hallway thing.
												<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span> Many
												cool 6 person seater bars. Super cool bar with a cool bar tender girl that was trying
												to speak with us. She had her own friends there also and we were all drinking together.
												Told them I was gay and had an interesting conversation about that. Asked about hot
												japanese actors haha. Hoped to another random bar and got a beer. Super weird vibe.
												Not our favorite so we left. Went back to original bar. Had more fun convos. White
												guys that knew the bar owner, they got free alc. Went home alone without Noah at around
												4am. Walked back alone. Super cool to see all the streets dead. I was intoxicated haha.
												Came back and slept. Noah got back at 7amish

												Got kicked out of “home” hostel at 11am. Got 2 sick drinking glasses.
												One from the pac hostel and one from the random bar in the bar hallway.
												Went to the pax hostel. Super cool vibe. Hung out in the cafe part,
												rank water and listened to Noah play the guitar. Caught up with the
												friend I made the other day at pax. Ate at a “Denny’s” of japan place.
												Super yummy and filling. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>
												Super hungover and took a 40min nap. Got up and
												started to walk around but realized we were both way too hungover to do
												anything touristy. Went to an indoor climbing gym instead and sweat the
												hangover all out haha. Doguyauji walk. Super fun and full of activity.
												There was a really weird metal ball gambling game that a lot of people
												were playing. Very loud and very smokey. Got to the bouldering spot.
												<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span>
												Super fun. Color grading system determined by tape color and shape.
												Very interesting and hard to adjust to at first. Talking to locals about
												climbing. Fun to watch each other climb. No beta spraying which was really
												nice. Went to a mini grill top place and had tons of interesting cuts of
												meat. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>
												Noah wasn’t a fan of intestine. He wanted to shower before but we
												didn’t have enough time. The waiters were really nice. We were thinking
												about buying the waiter a beer but decided it might not be respectful.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Talked about finding a partner, being gay, difficulties of that with love life.
												Noah made a joke about how I am the most straight gay guy and a very American
												Asian. Went into a massive sex shop. Was super funny to see all the sex toys.
												assive dildos, 100’s of types of flesh lights. 6 story building top 3 floors
												were cool. Got boba. They used condensed milk. Not my favorite ever of best
												in japan so far. Have had only 2 cups though. 😂 Back to the hostel for shower.
												Noah and the main hostel guy were jamming out on the guitar. Queued at a
												revolving sushi place in dotonburi. It was alright and reasonably priced. We
												went at the end so none of the popular fish was being served. Noah’s nav skills
												are “good”. 🤣 I’m paying for everything and thought that Noah didn’t have a
												0% foreign fee card. Still gonna do it all cus I have been and it’ll be easier
												in the end. Went to a lonely planet recommended ramen joint in “queue hell” lol.
												Accidentally got the chicken based broth. Not very happy with it but hey, it was
												 only $6. Walked home. Chatted about personality tendencies and debated how
												 cool it is to travel without a schedule. Met two people at the hostel 1st floor,
												 Dan and mizu. Went to sleep.

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Woke up early and talked to mom, did laundry, dried my clothes. Super nice and realxing.
											On top of the roof, I could tell the day would have amazing weather. Went back and took
											an hr nap. Woke up at 9:15am. Went downstairs to wait for Noah to get ready. Talked to
											mom again. We chatted about D, my time in japan, my goal of learning Thai while in
											Taiwan to prepare for my trip. Drank a lot of water. Noah came down and got a coffee.
											Talked to hostel front desk person about shopping and food suggestions. Rented bikes.
											I got a bright yellow one and Noah got a red one. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>
											We pumped both tires full of air and
											then went off. On our way to omarice, we passed by a restaurant we saw yesterday that
											had a 20 person queue. Funny enough it was 15mins before it opened and we decided to
											send it. The place had almost 10 people already waiting in line! We got in with the first
											round of people. So incredible timing! The dishes were the best thing I have had in Japan
											so far. The pork was unbelievably crispy, the curry was super rich and the eggs were nice
											and moist. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #2]</span> This was the best and biggest
											food send of the trip thus far. Very happy we did this. Made me realize I need to do this
											style of traveling in Thailand. Don’t get tunnel vision in Thailand Patrick lol!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Biked our way to the castle in Osaka. As soon as we got there Noah needed to use the restroom
											so I got the chance to journal on the border of the castle and look out at the blue water. The
											Osaka castle was cool! Paid 600yen to get in. Nice view from the top. Cool history lesson in
											the history part of the castle. Biking was super fun in the castle area. We bikes in circles
											around each other for awhile. People were giving us weird looks but it was chill and kinda funny.
											After the castle, we biked to umeda sky building and saw another amazing city view of Tokyo.
											super surprised that we didn’t have to pay anything to get to the 39th floor. It was funny
											because it was 1500 yen to get to the 40th floor hahah. Made no sense. It was cool to see all
											the cops on the streets getting ready for the G20 summit. From here we got super tasty boba
											from a Taiwanese boba shop. I got the milk and brown sugar. I do not regret! Almost didn’t
											get one and then saw that there were a ton of girls drinking the boba inside. Good sign of good
											boba is popularity so I got one. Noah accidentally got the to go cup upgrade which was 150 yen haha.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											Went back to the hostel to get ready for the speak easy bar. The speak easy bar was amazing!
											It was hidden on the 5th floor of a building in the popular part of japan. There were a few funny
											posters that had funny excerpts. I had two drinks. One was a whiskey based drink (I think it was
											a combo of a ton of expensive whiskies and the other was a drink that Noah ordered for me. It was
											fun based and tasted so amazing. The bar was small and seemed very secretive. There was no menu and
											the bar tenders had a flare to every drink they made. The people were also amazing. We met a couple
											rom Seattle traveling to a bachelor and bachelorette party in Thailand. Maybe Noah will meet up with
											them one day? The other two were from Wisconsin. The girl worked at Epic for 5 years and therefore
											got a month vacation and was able to bring a partner. The guy works in tech and tried to make his own
											startup make a social media recommendation app.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											After the speak easy we walked around for a bit before hitting up a random backpackers bar. It was
											very empty and didn’t have a good vibe. Also, the Mexican food looked to be questionable. At this location
											 we met a father who was going out while his son was staying in eating pizza and chilling. There was also
											  a lady that came in after us, talked to the waiter for 10 seconds and then put her head on the bar and
												proceeded to fall asleep. After this we got food at a random udon and bbq place. Noah thought it was
												something that it was not so he only got a beer. I got udon with a good soft boiled egg. After this, we
												went back to the hotel and met Ricardo and Nina. Two super cool people Ricardo was from Norway and Nina
												was from Germany. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>They both met each other in Tokyo and
												decided to travel with each other to Osaka. We went for revolving sushi which was amazing for its price!
												Only 1 dollar a plate! Also, there was a self serve beer machine. Omg it was a great time and we went
												with our two new friends. There was also a game that would be played for every 5 plates we ate. It was
												a great way to get us to spend haha. I ate sooooo much sushi!
												</p>

												<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Afterwards we went to a billiards bar near
												dontonburi. Super low key but nice vibe. Met two more friends named Zane and ___ they were both from the
												UK and we’re good childhood friends. They decided to travel together and were having a good time. I talk to
												Zane for awhile. Talked about US politics, league, and why UK people say “that’s alright”. While we were
												playing pool and everyone was watching. I hit 3 shots in a row, two of which were very impressive. I
												think everyone was impressed. Couldn’t really hit a shot after that haha. Then I went to play darts for
												a bit with Noah and Ricardo. Dam we smelt like cigarettes after leaving the bar. I didn’t snake but being
												in a smoke room was not good for my clothes or lungs. Stopped at a family mart. Noah was looking for
												the sweet savory rice balls on a stick. After we left we went back to the hostel and fell asleep.
