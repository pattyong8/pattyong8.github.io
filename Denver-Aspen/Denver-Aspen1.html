											This trip was dedicated to supporting both Connor and Lucas in their Spartan Race Ultra.
											I do not understand how they were physically able to run 30+ miles, complete 60+ obstacles,
											and still talk after the race. So impressive. Matt and I spent our time exploring the area,
											going on hikes, and waiting for Connor and Lucas to cross the finishline. Denver feels very
											similar to Seattle. Aspen was beautiful and the Maroon Bells were breathtaking. Glad I was
											able to experience a new city and support my best friends all in one trip!

											<h2>Day 1</h2>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 20px">
											Just got picked up from the airport by Ryan and Connor. So nice to see both of them. We rode to the airport in a red car that Connor said barely works. Lol. Ryan actually almost didnâ€™t make it back home after he dropped us off. Connor and I got through security, just did some small talk while going to the airport. I asked about his trip and his time at home. He talked about his day to day at home, his short LA trip, and his Croatia trip. Connor asked about the craziest thing on my Japan, Taiwan, Thailand trip. Connor and I finally got onto the plane after some delays. I got a window seat and started listening to a podcast that Dixon sent me. Excited to see Matt and Lucas! I did not enjoy the plane ride. There was an annoying baby in front of me and the guy next to me did not understand the idea of personal space.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											When we landed, we had to wait in the airport landing zone for an hour because there was backup in the gate loading zone. After what felt like a lifetime, we finally were allowed to disembark the plane. Connor and I walked quickly to the airport train and were right on time since the train was arriving as we got there. We called a Lyft and waited at zone 5, on floor 5, at island 5 lol. Our driver arrived and we got in. We picked up one more person since it was a pool. On the drive to Mattâ€™s place, Connor and I talked about how excited we were to see Matt and for the rest of the trip. After we dropped off the first passenger, the driver jumped into the conversation after I started talking about backpacking through Asia.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
											The driver talked about her dogs for awhile. She spent the rest of the ride describing the physical appearance and traits of her dogs. How people in Denver love their dogs lol. Got to Mattâ€™s apartment. His place was right above the Ritz Carlton. Omg haha. Matt and Lucas met us at the bottom of the building and brought us up. Ahhhh it was so nice to see them! We quickly got ready for bed and crashed. Before this, I eat an egg queso. I slept on the couch, Connor was in Mattâ€™s bed and Lucas was on the pullout thing.

												We got up early the next morning and headed to Bishop to climb! OMG I was so excited to get on some
												rock :). I drove the rental car since Noah's car was not fit for any amount of off-roading. First, we stopped to
												rental a couple of crash pads. Noah also decided to buy a Bishop bouldering guide book.
												We decided to start at the Dreamers first.  Noah directed
												off the main road onto a questionable dirt road. There was no final desination in sight. The road slowly got
												less flat and more rocky. We could tell that something wasn't right. Turns out we took a wrong turn.
												We had to carefully turn around while avoiding all the bushes and mini boulders around the dirt road. The car
												got a bit scratched up but we figured it wasn't too bad.
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Eventually, we got to the Dreamers <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #1]</span>. Wow it was beautiful and
												the rock felt so nice. I hadn't gone bouldering outdoors that much in my life so it was still a bit
												scary to do high ball V0s. The first climb we "warmed up" on was a V0 with tons of pockets and jugs called Borbon 4.
												After topping a few climbs, my nerves settled and I became more adventurous with the climbs I picked.
												We climbed a V2 and some others before taking a break and eating lunch. Had some super yummy avocado turkey
												sandwiches and beer! <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span> The snow cap mountains around us were absolutely beautiful. So amazing to just to be outside.
												Noah took out some binoculars to look around the area. Cody then used them and saw a rock formation in the distance
												that we wanted check out. Cody being his typical self walk/jogged to the rock formation to check it out.

												After lunch, we got a few "aciton" shots of us climbing with the white cap mountains in the background. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #3, #4, & #5]</span>
												We then decided to head over to Happy boulders. Wow, the Happy boulders area was amazing.
												There were sooooo many boulders everywhere! It was basically the Disneyland of the climbing world.
												Noah and Cody were attempting harder problems since their skill level was above mine and Shiv's.
												My favorite climb was this classic V4 <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #6]</span>. Very nice problem.
												I didn't do it but it was very fun to attempt! We also took fun pictures on some V0s <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #7]</span>.

												Before heading back for the night, we stopped at the natural hotsprings 30mins from the city of
												Mammoth. The hotsprings were in the middle of a rocky grassy field. To get to the hotsprings,
												we had to walk on a short man made path. We finally arrived at the hotsprings. The air was cold
												and we were eager to get in. There were three main pool with varying temperatures. As we were soaking
												in medium temperature pool, a snow storm hit. Omg it was freezing and all of our clothes were getting covered
												in a thin layer white snow. We decided to stay a longer since this nautral event was more fun than not. We got
												some great photos using Shiv's phone <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #8 & #9]</span>.

												After taking everything in, we decided to make a break for the car. The situation was tricky since the snow
												storm was still going on and it was freezing outside of the hotsprings. I volunteered to get out first, run
												to the car, and blast the heaters. Everyone else followed after I got dressed and started up the man made path.
												I practically scrambled to the car. I couldn't feel anything and was numb all over. Everyone else slowly arrived
												to the car and threw themselves in. Wow what a fun way to end the day. We drove back to Noah's place and took a
												nice long rest. Once we felt rested, we watched a climbing movie and went to sleep.

												Got up early to go climbing again! This time, we decided to go to Sad Boulders.
												Since it was my second day climbing outdoors in a row, I felt much more comfortable
												with high climbs and got over my fear of loose rocks. I actually attempted a V0
												highball and got pretty far up before deciding to come down. We probably climbing for
												a couple of hours. During this time, we attempted a range of climbs from V0-V5. We also
												got some amazing pictures of the view! <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Pictures #1 & #2]</span>
												I also got way better at spotting people while they were climbing. Specifically, I had two
												superb spots with Cody. One of these was a quite dangerous climb. Cody put in a very high heel
												hook 6 feet off the ground and had to trust the foot and reach for a hold. On one of his attempts,
												he missed the hand hold and came falling down. The bad part was that his heel hook made him fall back first.
												I was spotting him and perfectly caught his body to prevent a potentially harmful impact. Cody said it was
												as if an angel came down, grabbed him while he was falling, and floated him down to the mat :). Worlds best spotter
												here!
											</p>

											<p style="text-indent: 50px; font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.5">
												Towards the end of the day, we started to take some funny pics. <span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #3]</span>
												We were pretty exhausted from 3 days worth of activites and headed back at a reasonable time to recover and return
												crash pads. We also decided to grab a bit to eat at a Mexican resturant that Noah spoke highly of.
												<span style="color: #00d8d5">[Picture #4]</span> Once we got back, we decided to hit the jaccuzi and drink a bit.
